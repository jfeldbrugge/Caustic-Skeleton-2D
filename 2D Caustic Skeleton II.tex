The comic web consists of a complex configuration of voids, walls, filaments, and clusters, which formed under the gravitational collapse of Gaussian fluctuations. Understanding under what conditions these different structures emerge from simple initial conditions, and how different cosmological models influence their evolution, is central to the study of the large-scale structure. Here, we present a general formalism for setting up Gaussian random initial conditions satisfying non-linear constraints for specialized $N$-body simulations. These allow us to link the non-linear conditions on the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the deformation tensor, as specified by caustic skeleton theory, to the current day cosmic web. By extending constraint Gaussian random field theory, and the corresponding Hoffman-Ribak algorithm, to non-linear constraints, we can probe the statistical properties of the progenitors of the walls, filaments, and clusters of the cosmic web. Applied to cosmological $N$-body simulations, the proposed techniques pave the way towards a systematic investigation of the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day walls, filaments, and clusters, and the embedded galaxies, putting flesh on the bones of the caustic skeleton. While we develop non-linear constraint Gaussian random field theory in generality, the case study presented here probes the two-dimensional caustic skeleton for ease of visualization.

\section{Introduction}
In this study diligently we extend and elaborate our analytical model for the
formation of the cosmic web \citep{zeldovich1970,bond1996,weybond2008},
and its complex
multiscale network of filaments and sheets, by the Caustic Skeleton
model\citet{feldbrugge2019}. The formalism, expressions and details were
introduced
and extensively described in \citet{feldbrugge2019}. It entails an exact
and computationally practical set of expressions for inferring the  full
two- or three-dimensional skeleton of the cosmic web \footnote{The
caustic conditions underlying the model that are derived in
\citep{feldbrugge2019} are
   applicable for any N-dimensional space} emerging from any
cosmological primordial field of linear density and velocity
perturbations. It extends the early
studies by the Soviet mathematician Arnold and collaborators
\citep{arnold1982}, that studied the caustic structure predicted by teh
Zeldovich formalism
\citep{zeldovich1970}.

While the Caustic Skeleton details the structural outline of the nodes,
filamentary branches, and sheetlike membranes that constitute the
skeleton of the
cosmic web, in the present study we develop the formalism to detail the
mass distribution in and around the caustic sksleton. To be able to
predict the mass distribution in and around filaments and walls,
including the density profiles along as well as perpendicular the
filamentary ridges
and sheetlike membranes, we develop a fully nonlinear constraiend field
formalism. It is an extension and elaboration of the linear constrained
field formalims
introduced by \cite{bertschinger1987}, and futher developed in
\citet{hofrib1991} and \citet{weyedb1996}.

We subsequently implement the (nonlinear) caustic conditions for the
caustic conditions pertaining to the various structural features of the
cosmic web.
It allows us to explore in detail, and to great depth, the processes in
and around the evolving feat8res of the cosmic web and the hierarchical
buildup of the
connections between the various components of the cosmic web. While the
present study is the first in a series detailing the evolution of
the mass distribution in and around the cosmic web, for reasons of
presentation and clarity the present study is limited to the
two-dimensional situation.

\subsection{the Cosmic Web}
The cosmic web is the largest complex structural pattern known in nature
and is the fundamental spatial organization of matter, gas and galaxies
on scales of a few up to a hundred Megaparsec
\citep{Shandarin:1989,Bond:1996,Weygaert:2008}. Galaxies, intergalactic
gas and dark matter exist in a wispy weblike arrrangement of dense
compact clusters, elongated filaments, and sheetlike membranes surrounding
near-empty void regions. The prominent elongated filamentary features
form the dense boundaries around the large tenuous walls, and define
a network pervading the entire universe. The filaments connect up at
massive, compact clusters located at the nodes of the network, and together
with the walls they surround the vast, underdense and near-empty voids.
Around 50\% of dark matter and 50\% of galaxies, is residing in
filaments \citep[see eg.][]{Cautun:2014,Ganeshaiah:2019}. The complex
connectivity and intrinsic multiscale character reflect the primordial
conditions out of which the wealthy structure and variety of objects in
the Universe have emerged through gravitational evolution.

Cosmological observations are producing ever more detailed maps of the
spatial galaxy distribution, while a range of observational data are
accessing
the neutral and ionized gas distribution in the \textit{cosmic web}, and
even that of the dark matter distribution \citep{references}.
In the coming years a large array of major observational redshift
surveys in particular, those of Euclid, DESI, the Vera Rubin observatory
and SKA -- will map the weblike organization of galaxies over
unprecedented large cosmic volumes. Given this wealth of data, it is of
crucial importance to prepare for the systematic scientific exploration
of the cosmic web and study its dependence on the cosmological setting
in which it forms.
As the structure, dynamics and connectivity of the cosmic web depend
sensitively on the underlying cosmology, these new methods will exploit
the geometry and topology of the cosmic web to infer constraints on the
underlying physics and cosmological parameters.

\subsection{Phase-space evolution \& the Caustic Skeleton}
The process of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe
is driven by the gravitational growth of tiny primordial
density and velocity perturbations. When it reaches a stage at which the
matter distribution starts to develop nonlinearities, we see
the emergence of complex structural patterns.It is on these scales that
the universe displays its marked intricate weblike infrastructure,
the Cosmic Web. In the current universe we see this happening at
Megaparsec scales.

The evolution of the complex multiscale structure of the cosmic web is
the product of the interplay of a range of nonlinear processes. $N$-body
simulations, numerically simulating cosmological structure formation,
are very useful to obtain a good impression of the resulting structure.
However, even though several up-to-date projects provide a large number
of simulations that offer a good representation of many aspects of
the structure formation process \citep{ABACUSSUMMIT:2021, Quijote:2020},
they are usually demanding and expensive and do not possess the flexibility
to infer the required information on all relevant cosmological and
structure formation aspects. Full insight and understanding of the outcome
make it necessary to invoke complementary analytical models for the
interpretation of the results. These not only allow a solidly based
interpretation of simulated (and observational) realities but also -
even more importantly - provide direct and optimal insight into and
understanding of the workings of the relevant physical processes.

Of key importance for understanding the emergence of nonlinear structure
in the Universe is insight into the mass flows accompanying the
structure formation process. The first recognizable features to emerge
in the cosmic matter distribution are the flattened wall-like
and elongated filamentary features, along with the large underdense void
regions that assume most of the cosmic volume between these features.
Ultimately these merge into a pervasive weblike network. Their formation
is the result of the accumulation of different mass streams
at specific locations. Insight into this process is attained by
assessing the multistream nature of the mass flows, with walls and
filaments forming at locations where various mass streams meet up.
Insight into the formation of the cosmic web therefore calls
for a Lagrangian description of structure growth, taking into account
the full six-dimensional phase-space structure of the
mass distribution \citep[see][for key contributions on
this.]{shandarin2010,shandarin2011,abel2011,falck2012}.

The first stages of cosmic structure formation are remarkably accurately
described by the analytical framework of the
Zeldovich approximation \citep{zeldovich1970}. The first-order
Lagrangian description has proven to work extremely well
until nonlinear gravitational evolution induces contraction and
collapse, and the appearance of multistream regions. This goes
along with the emergence of the first nontrivial wall-like and elongated
features in the cosmic matter distribution. It not
only represents a remarkably accurate description of the evolving mass
distribution up to the appearance
of multi-stream regions, it also suggests the morphology of a cellular
or weblike arrangement of matter in the universe and hence
predicted the later detection of the weblike organization of galaxies
and gas in the Universe
\citep{einasto19777,lapparent1986,colless2003,huchra2010,vipers2012}.

For further insight into the nonlinear evolution of the mass
distribution after the emergence of multistream regions, the Caustic
Skeleton
model concentrates on the features that form at the locations where the
different gravitationally directed mass streams meet up. These
form the skeleton around which subsequently matter assembles and
virializes into recognizable physical objects. As seen from the full
six-dimensional phase-space perspective, they are the projections of a
three-dimensional mass sheet in six-dimensional phase space on
to the spatial (Eulerian) volume. There where different mass streams
cross at a particular location, the sheet is folded and the projection
of these folds are seen as



Given the importance of basing the analysis of cosmic web observations
on a good analytical model for its nonlinear evolution, the present
study involves the further development of the Caustic Skeleton model of
the cosmic web that we introduced in \citep{Feldbrugge:2018}.



As purely numerical simulations are very expensive,
a more flexible and versatile procedure would involve the use of
numerical methods based on a foundation of analytical descriptions of
the structure formation process. Not only would this result in a more
versatile formalism for inferring the requested information on
underlying physical and cosmological processes, it would also entail a
substantially more profound and versatile insight into the physical
process driving the formation and evolution of the cosmic web.

\medskip
Given the importance of basing the analysis of cosmic web observations
on a good analytical model for its nonlinear evolution, the present
study involves the further development of the Caustic Skeleton model of
the cosmic web that we introduced in \citep{Feldbrugge:2018}. The model
tracks the evolution of the dark matter sheet in six-dimensional
\textit{phase-space} and marks the locations where the fluid forms
caustics, highlighting the place and time where gravitational collapse
turns non-linear and walls, filaments, and clusters emerge in terms of a
set of non-linear conditions on the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of
the deformation tensor. Moreover, these caustic mark the locations where
these structures merge to form the interconnected structure which we
observe today. When combining caustic theory with an analytic model of
large-scale structure formation, such as the Zel'dovich approximation,
these caustics define the \textit{caustic skeleton}, marking the
locations and configurations in the initial conditiohns that are the
progenitors of the intricate geometric pattern of the cosmic web. This
approach turns out to be remarkably successful at linking the intricate
geometry and topology of the cosmic web to specific features in the much
simpler Gaussian initial conditions.

Caustic skeleton theory models the cosmic web in terms of a skeleton
consisting of several singular features (sheets, curves and points).
However, redshift surveys and lensing surveys show the large scale
structure in terms of the spatial distribution of galaxies and the
underlying dark matter. In the present study, we bridge this gap by
extending constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear
constraints and demonstrating how the caustic conditions of the caustic
skeleton are incorporated in this framework. Using this formalism, we
infer the analytic properties of the initial density perturbation and
gravitational potential in the vicinity of the progenitors of the walls,
filaments and clusters of the cosmic web. By running a set of $N$-body
simulations on these initial conditions, we can infer the formation
histories and present-day properties of the various elements of the
caustic skeleton, putting flesh on the bones of the caustic skeleton. In
the current case study, we demonstrate non-linear constraint Gaussian
random field theory to the two-dimensional caustic skeleton for ease of
visualization, paving the road to a systematic study of the different
features of the three-dimensional cosmic web using a set of small scale
cosmological $N$-body simulations

The study of the cosmic web has a remarkable correspondence to
statistical field theory for the study of phase transition in
thermodynamics. Both theories describe the emergent behaviour of a large
number of particles described by a Euclidean path integral
\cite{Feynman:1965}. We are hopeful that the well-established path
integral techniques will be also beneficial to the further systematic
and analytic exploration of the intricate cosmic web.


\subsection{Nonlinear Constrained Field Theory}


\subsection{Outline}
The paper begins section \ref{sec:Caustic_Skeleton_Theory} with a
concise summary of Lagrangian fluid dynamics and two-dimensional caustic
skeleton theory illustrated with a set of examples. In section
\ref{sec:Eulerian_space} we provide a visual justification of the
caustic skeleton by illustrating the evolution of the skeleton using a
dark matter only two-dimensional $N$-body simulation. In particular, we
show that the skeleton based the Zel'dovich approximation is applicable
to the current cosmic web, where the Zel'dovich approximation it self
breaks down. We subsequently extend constraint Gaussian random field
theory to include non-linear constraints in section \ref{sec:GRF}. Using
this formalism, we implement the caustic conditions and evaluate the
mean field of the different elements of the two-dimensional caustic
skeleton in section \ref{sec:caustic_skeleton_constraints}. In section
\ref{sec:composite_constraints}, we extend non-linear constraint
Gaussian random field theory to multiple caustic conditions at different
locations. This paves the way to a systematic study of the interplay
between the walls, filaments, and clusters of the cosmic web. Finally,
in section \ref{sec:conclusion} we summarize the results and discuss
possible applications.




\noindent

The gravitational structure formation process is marked by vast
migration streams, known as cosmic flows. Inhomogeneities in
the gravitational force field lead to the displacement of mass out of
the lower density areas towards higher density regions.
Complex structures arise at the locations where different mass streams
meet up. Gravitational collapse sets in as this happens.
In terms of six-dimensional phase space, it corresponds to the local
folding of the phase space sheet along which matter -- in particular
the gravitationally dominant dark matter component -- has distributed
itself.

The positions where streams of the dark matter fluid cross are the sites
where gravitational collapse occurs. The various types of
caustics described and classified in our study mark the different
configurations in which this process may take place. Their locations
trace out a Lagrangian skeleton of the emerging cosmic web, marking key
structural elements and establishing their connectivity
(also see the discussion in \cite{Hidding:2014}). In other words, the
$A_3,A_4,A_5,D_4,D_5$ varieties, in combination with the
corresponding $A_3^\pm, A_4^\pm,$ and $D_4^\pm$ points, are the
dynamical elements whose connectivity defines the weaving of the
the cosmic web
\citep{Zeldovich:1970,bondweb1996,weybond2008,aragon2010,cautun2014}.

On the basis of this observation, we may obtain the skeleton of the
cosmic web in Eulerian space by
means of the Lagrangian map $x_t$ to Eulerian space. Following the
identification of the various
caustic varieties and caustic points in Lagrangian space, the
application of the map $x_t$ will
produce the corresponding weblike structure in Eulerian space. A telling
example of the resulting
patterns and their comparison with a fully nonlinear N-body simulation
of the corresponding
evolving matter distribution is shown in figure~\ref{fig:Nbody}.

\section{The Caustic Skeleton \& Cosmic Web
illustrated}\label{sec:Eulerian_space}
In a first step towards elucidating and appreciating the intimate
connection between the cosmic mass distribution in the cosmic web
and its analytically predicted spine by the Caustic Skeleton model, we
provide a visual impression of the primordial
inhomogeneous matter distribution and corresponding inhomogeneous and
anisotropic gravitational force field.

In the present study we limit our treatment to the gravitationally
evolving dark matter distribution in a two-dimensional setting .
The cosmic web is the product of the gravitationally propelled evolution
of the primordial field of Gaussian random density and
velocity fluctuations. At each cosmic epoch, the mass distribution
attains a weblike morphology at the scale at which the
matter distribution evolves away from its initial linear evolution and
nonlinear features start to appear as mass concentrations
decouple from the Hubble expansion and start to contract
gravitationally. At this quasi-linear phase, the migration streams involved
in the buildup of structure start to cross, and we see the emergence of
multistream regions at the locations of the emerging
nonlinear features.

The development of the dark mark distribution in the corresponding
four-dimensional phase-space can be seen as that of a gradually
deforming two-dimensional {\it dark matter sheet} embedded in 4-D phase
space. Also, for a visually direct assessment of the relation between
the structural components of the cosmic web and the caustic
singularities arising in the matter distribution,
we confine our attention to the patterns observed in Eulerian space.

\subsection{Caustics vs. Nbody simulation}
The {\it reference} cosmic mass distribution that we discuss in this
section concerns the dark matter distribution in a two-dimensional
realization. The cosmological background is a flat Einstein-de Sitter
universe with a dark matter density $\Omega_m=1$ and
Hubble constant $H_0=71\text{ Mpc/s/km}$. Structure evolves
gravitationally out of a primordial Gaussian random field with
power-law power spectrum. The corresponding gravitational potential
$\phi_0$ has a powerlaw spectrum $P_{\phi}(lk) \propto k^{n_s}$,
with a high-frequency cutoff at a smoothing scale $R_s$. For the present
reference model The power law index $n_s=-1$, the cutoff scale
$R_s=2.5 \text{ Mpc}$. The map of the Gaussian random potential field is
shown in the top lefthand frame in figure~\ref{}, with the
corresponding map of the density field $\delta$ in the top righthand
frame of the same figure.

The primordial mass distribution is evolved to the current epoch (z=0).
For the purpose of the present study, the evolution is
followed in two ways. A two-dimensional dark matter $N$-body simulation
\cite{Hidding:2020} is
used to follow the full nonlinear evolution of the mass distribution. It
consists of a $512^3$ particle simulation
in a box of $200 \mbox{Mpc}$ length. In addition, also the Zel'dovich
approximation is used to follow the evolving mass
distribution. The first-order Lagrangian scheme is not only used to
obtain an approximate first-order impression of the
evolving mass distribution, but also as analytical foundation from which
we infer the caustic features implied
by the \cite{feldbrugge2019} caustic conditions.

The setting of the cosmological simulations is that of a two-dimensional
$\Lambda CDM$ resembling cosmology. We use the Zeldovich
approximation' analytical expression for the deformation tensor to infer
the nature, and Lagrangian location and environment of
caustic singularities in the modelled mass distribution.
Table~\ref{causticweb} provides the guidance for the morphological
identity of
the various caustic classes, applying the identification for the two-
and three-dimensional situations from \citep[see][]{feldbrugge2019}.
The Eulerian location and environment of these caustic features may
subsequently be assessed
in the Zeldovich approximation by using the corresponding expression for
the displacement of a mass element. In the Nbody simulation,
their location follows from the simulation displaccment of the
corresponding mass elements.

The direct comparison between the evolving N-body particle distribution
allows us to assess the position and role of the various caustics
within the cosmic mass distribution, and in particular that in the
weblike network in which it has organized itself.


Most noteworthy is the - as yet not yet appreciated -
observation that filaments come in two classes \citep{feldbrugge2019}.
The major share of the filamentary network is represented by
$A_4$ swallowtail caustics, representing the sectional interfaces
between two wall-like membranes. These have not yet fully collapsed along
two directions. Umbilic $D_4$ caustics are also filaments, corresponding
to the more prominent and dense filamentary extensions of the cluster
nodes in the cosmic web and representing filaments that have fully
collapsed along two directions.








\subsection{Primordial Deformation Field and Cosmic Web}
At the heart of the caustic conditions in \citep{feldbrugge2019} is the
observation that the caustic singularities that
are emerging in the matter distribution, and the structural weblike
components surrounding them, are determined by
the deformation and tidal field induced by the inhomogeneous mass
distribution \citep{zeldovich1970,weyedb1996,weybond2008,
   hidding2014}. The key role of the eigenvalues of the deformation
tensor in establishing the morphological
nature of cosmic structure has been acknowledged since the seminal
studies by \cite{zeldovich1970} and \cite{doroshkevich1970}.
It formed the basis for the expectation that the cosmic mass
distribution would be organized in a cellular pattern
\citep[also see]{shandzeld1989,sunyshand2014}. Only through the explicit
demonstration by \cite{feldbrugge2019} it has
become clear that the corresponding eigenvectors are instrumental in
establshing the structural pattern of the
cosmic web and its various components.

The two lower panels in figure~\ref{} provide a telling illustration of
the central role of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the deformation/tidal tensor in establishing the spatial
structure of the cosmic web.
For the gravitational potential and density maps in the top row, the
maps show the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ field
(bottom lefthand frame) and second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ field (bottom
righthand frame)  The corresponding
eigenvectors $\bm{v}_1$ and $\bm{v}_2$ are superimposed by means of
black solid bars oriented along the eigenvector
direction.

Whiler the density and gravitational potential maps represent Gaussian
random fields with a limited spatial coherence,
the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields reveal an entirely different
story. These fields are clearly non-Gaussian
\citep[see][]{doroshkevich1970}, marking a highly structured pattern.
Particularly outstanding is the high level of spatial
coherence of both maps. The primordial eigenvalue fields already reveal
a pervasive weblike network. It is a telling demonstration of the fact
that the deformation and tidal field are the key agents for
understanding the structure, formation and connectivity
of the cosmic web \citep[also see][]{wilding2022}.

\cite{hidding2014})



The multi-stream regions of the cosmic web forms gradually. At early
times, the {\it dark matter sheet} consists of a
single single-stream region.






\subsection{Multistream Regions and Caustic Spine}
The multi-stream regions of the cosmic web forms gradually.

Its evolution is neatly captured by the dynamics of the caustic skeleton
(see figure \ref{fig:Eulerian_Evolution}). As the mass elements undergo
gravitational collapse, we observe the formation of several Zel'dovich
pancakes corresponding to the maxima of the eigenvalue field $\lambda_1$
(see the upper left panel). These multi-stream regions grow and connect
at the saddle points of the eigenvalue fields to form the web-like
structure we observe in redshift surveys (see the upper right and lower
panels). Note that viralized filaments move coherently while the large
voids expand and the smaller voids contract. In this process several
filaments may merge to form more massive structures.








The Zel'dovich approximation clearly fails for late times. The
approximation linearly extrapolates the initial flow of the mass
elements, ignores any further change in the gravitational interactions,
and overshoots after shell-crossing (see the lower left panel of figure
\ref{fig:Eulerian}). However, even though the Zel'dovich approximation
no-longer accurately predicts the location of the multi-stream regions
and the density field, it does predict the locations and times at which
mass elements undergo shell-crossing and form caustics in Lagrangian
space at these late times (see the lower right panel). The fold curves
provide an reasonable approximation of the boundaries of the
multi-stream regions. The cusp curves neatly bisect the multi-stream
regions and form knots in the clusters of the cosmic web. Note that a
cluster rarely consists of a single cluster caustics. Caustic correlated
and together form intricate multi-stream regions in the knots. The
filaments evolve more linearly and can often be associated to an unique
cusp curve.

presents a visual illustration


To develop a visual appreciation of the roles of the different caustics
in the large scale structure and the accuracy of the caustic skeleton of
the Zel'dovich approximation, we construct a realization of an
unconstrained Gaussian random field with the spectral index $n_s=-1$ and
the   for the gravitational potential $\phi_0$ and

The caustic skeleton captures the geometry of the first eigenvalue and
eigenvector field $\lambda_1$ and $\bm{v}_1$ (see the upper left panel).
At late times, the cusp curves form an interconnected network tracing
multi-stream regions bounded by the fold curves. The blue regions
bounded by the fold curves are the progentors of the voids. At large
scales, the eigenvalue field closely resembles the initial density
perturbation $\delta_0 \propto \nabla^2\phi_0$ (see the upper right
panel). Moreover, at these scales, the caustic skeleton follows the
geometry of the superlevel sets of the density perturbation. However, on
small scales, we observe qualitative differences.

As we will show, the orientation and geometry of the shell-crossing
regions is further described by the eigenvector fields (see the lines in
the lower panels of figure \ref{fig:Initial_Conditions}). At initial
times, the eigenvector fields are normal, $\bm{v}_{t,1}\cdot
\bm{v}_{t,2}=0$, since the deformation tensor is symmetric. Observe that
the eigenvector fields exhibit an interesting correlation with the
eigenvalue fields. Roughly speaking, the eigenvector fields are normal
to the ridges of the corresponding eigenvalue fields. This observation
will play an important role in the discussion of the caustic skeleton
below.

In late time cosmology, the cosmic web forms due to the gravitational
collapse of tiny Gaussian fluctuations $\delta_0$. At early times, the
corresponding Gaussian gravitational potential $\phi_0$ governs the
dynamics of the mass elements, $\bm{s}_t \propto \nabla \phi_0$. See the
upper panels of figure \ref{fig:Initial_Conditions} for an illustration
of the initial density and the corresponding gravitational potential
fields\footnote{We model the gravitational potential with a power-law
power spectrum $P(k) \propto k^{n_s}$ with an index $n_s=-1$ smoothed
with a Gaussian filter on the length scale $R_s=5\text{ Mpc}$.}.
Eulerian fluid dynamics describes the early evolution of the density
field in terms of these Gaussian fields. In contrast, Lagrangian fluid
dynamics emphasises the role of the deformation tensor $\nabla \bm{s}_t$
and the corresponding non-Gaussian eigenvalue and eigenvector fields
(see the density formula \eqref{eq:density}). It follows from the
eigenequation \eqref{eq:EigenvalueAndEigenvector} that the eigenvalue
fields are the quadratic (or cubic) roots of a polynomial whose
coefficients depend on the first order derivatives of the displacement
field in 2D (or 3D). The non-linearity of the eigenvalue fields captures
part of the non-linear dynamics of gravitational collapse. At early
times the deformation tensor $\nabla \bm{s}_t$ is proportional to the
Hessian of the gravitational potential, $\nabla \bm{s}_t \propto
\mathcal{H}\phi_0$. The eigenvalue and eigenvector fields are nonlinear
functions of the second order derivatives of the initial gravitational
potential. See the lower panels of figure \ref{fig:Initial_Conditions}
for an illustration of the non-Gaussian nature of the eigenvalue fields
corresponding to the gravitational potential in the upper left panel.

The red regions experience an inflow of matter, leading to the first
caustics. The blue regions represent an initial outflow of matter.
Roughly speaking, the eigenvalue fields peak in the regions of high
initial density. In particular, compare the peaks of the initial density
field $\delta_0$ and the second eigenvalue field $\mu_{t,2}$. However,
the density perturbation and the eigenvalue fields differ away from
these high density regions. The eigenvalue fields emphasise line-like
features connecting the high density regions. As described below, these
line-like features of the first eigenvalue field are the progenitors of
the filaments of the cosmic web.

%\section{Introduction}
%The cosmic web is the largest complex structural pattern known in nature and is the fundamental spatial organization of matter, gas and galaxies on scales of a few up to a hundred Megaparsec \citep{Shandarin:1989,Bond:1996,Weygaert:2008}. Galaxies, intergalactic
%gas and dark matter exist in a wispy weblike arrrangement of dense compact clusters, elongated filaments, and sheetlike membranes
%surrounding near-empty void regions. Cosmological observations are producing ever more detailed maps of the spatial galaxy distribution, while a range of observational data are accessing the neutral and ionized gas distribution in the \textit{cosmic web}, and even that of the dark matter distribution \citep{references}. Around 50\% of dark matter and 50\% of galaxies, is residing in filaments \citep[see eg.][]{Cautun:2014,Ganeshaiah:2019}. The complex connectivity and intrinsic multiscale character reflect the primordial conditions out of which the wealthy structure and variety of objects in the Universe have emerged through gravitational evolution.
%
%In the coming years a large array of major observational redshift surveys in particular, those of Euclid, DESI, the Vera Rubin observatory and SKA -- will map the weblike organization of galaxies over unprecedented large cosmic volumes. Given this wealth of data, it is of crucial importance to prepare for the systematic scientific exploration of the cosmic web. As the structure, dynamics and connectivity of the cosmic web depend sensitively on the underlying cosmology, these new methods will exploit the geometry and topology of the cosmic web to infer constraints on the underlying physics and cosmological parameters. 
%
%The emerging complex multiscale structure of the cosmic web is the product of the interplay of a range of nonlinear processes. $N$-body simulations, numerically simulating cosmological structure formation, are very useful to obtain a good impression of the
%emerging structure. However, even tough several up-to-date projects provide a large number of simulations that offer a good representation of many aspects of the structure formation process \citep{ABACUSSUMMIT:2021, Quijote:2020}, they are usually too expensive and do not possess the flexibility to infer the required information on all relevant cosmological and structure formation aspects. As purely numerical simulations are very expensive, a more flexible and versatile procedure would involve the use of numerical methods based based on a foundation of analytical descriptions of the structure formation process. Not only would this result in a more versatile formalism for inferring the requested information on underlying physical and cosmological processes, it would also entail a substantially more profound and versatile insight into the physical process driving the formation and evolution of the cosmic web.
%
%Given the importance of basing the analysis of cosmic web observations on a good analytical model for its nonlinear evolution, the present study involves the further development of the Caustic Skeleton model of the cosmic web that we introduced in \citep{Feldbrugge:2018}. The model tracks the evolution of the dark matter sheet in six-dimensional \textit{phase-space} and marks the locations where the fluid forms caustics, highlighting the place and time where gravitational collapse turns non-linear and walls, filaments, and clusters emerge in terms of a set of non-linear conditions on the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the deformation tensor. Moreover, these caustic mark the locations where these structures merge to form the interconnected structure which we observe today. When combining caustic theory with an analytic model of large-scale structure formation, such as the Zel'dovich approximation, these caustics define the \textit{caustic skeleton}, marking the locations and configurations in the initial conditions that are the progenitors of the intricate geometric pattern of the cosmic web. This approach turns out to be remarkably successful at linking the intricate geometry and topology of the cosmic web to specific features in the much simpler Gaussian initial conditions.
%
%Caustic skeleton theory models the cosmic web in terms of a skeleton consisting of several singular features (sheets, curves and points). However, redshift surveys and lensing surveys show the large scale structure in terms of the spatial distribution of galaxies and the underlying dark matter. In the present study, we bridge this gap by extending constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear constraints and demonstrating how the caustic conditions of the caustic skeleton are incorporated in this framework. Using this formalism, we infer the analytic properties of the initial density perturbation and gravitational potential in the vicinity of the progenitors of the walls, filaments and clusters of the cosmic web. By running a set of $N$-body simulations on these initial conditions, we can infer the formation histories and present-day properties of the various elements of the caustic skeleton, putting flesh on the bones of the caustic skeleton. In the current case study, we demonstrate non-linear constraint Gaussian random field theory to the two-dimensional caustic skeleton for ease of visualization, paving the road to a systematic study of the different features of the three-dimensional cosmic web using a set of small scale cosmological $N$-body simulations
%
%The study of the cosmic web has a remarkable correspondence to statistical field theory for the study of phase transition in thermodynamics. Both theories describe the emergent behaviour of a large number of particles described by a Euclidean path integral \cite{Feynman:1965}. The path integral in statistical field theory emerges from the thermal fluctuations of an ensemble of particles. Its study and related techniques such as mean field theory, has been very successful at tracing the universal features of thermodynamic systems, for example predicting the critical exponents. The path integral of late time cosmology has a different origin, resulting from the statistical properties the density fluctuations at the time of re-combination, as observed in the surface of last scattering in the cosmic microwave background radiation field. We are hopeful that the well-established path integral techniques will be also beneficial to the further systematic and analytic exploration of the intricate cosmic web.
%
%The paper begins section \ref{sec:Caustic_Skeleton_Theory} with a concise summary of Lagrangian fluid dynamics and two-dimensional caustic skeleton theory illustrated with a set of examples. In section \ref{sec:Eulerian_space} we provide a visual justification of the caustic skeleton by illustrating the evolution of the skeleton using a dark matter only two-dimensional $N$-body simulation. In particular, we show that the skeleton based the Zel'dovich approximation is applicable to the current cosmic web, where the Zel'dovich approximation it self breaks down. We subsequently extend constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear constraints in section \ref{sec:GRF}. Using this formalism, we implement the caustic conditions and evaluate the mean field of the different elements of the two-dimensional caustic skeleton in section \ref{sec:caustic_skeleton_constraints}. In section \ref{sec:composite_constraints}, we extend non-linear constraint Gaussian random field theory to multiple caustic conditions at different locations. This paves the way to a systematic study of the interplay between the walls, filaments, and clusters of the cosmic web. Finally, in section \ref{sec:conclusion} we summarize the results and discuss possible applications.

%\section{The caustic skeleton in Eulerian space}\label{sec:Eulerian_space}
%To develop a visual appreciation of the roles of the different caustics in the large scale structure and the accuracy of the caustic skeleton of the Zel'dovich approximation, we construct a realization of an unconstrained Gaussian random field with the spectral index $n_s=-1$ and the smoothing scale $R_s=2.5 \text{ Mpc}$ for the gravitational potential $\phi_0$ and evolve it with the Zel'dovich approximation and a small two-dimensional dark matter $N$-body simulation \cite{Hidding:2020} (see figure \ref{fig:Eulerian}) in a flat Einstein-de Sitter universe with the dark matter density $\Omega_m=1$ and Hubble constant $H_0=71\text{ Mpc/s/km}$. 
%
%The caustic skeleton captures the geometry of the first eigenvalue and eigenvector field $\lambda_1$ and $\bm{v}_1$ (see the upper left panel). At late times, the cusp curves form an interconnected network tracing multi-stream regions bounded by the fold curves. The blue regions bounded by the fold curves are the progentors of the voids. At large scales, the eigenvalue field closely resembles the initial density perturbation $\delta_0 \propto \nabla^2\phi_0$ (see the upper right panel). Moreover, at these scales, the caustic skeleton follows the geometry of the superlevel sets of the density perturbation. However, on small scales, we observe qualitative differences. 
%
%The Zel'dovich approximation clearly fails for late times. The approximation linearly extrapolates the initial flow of the mass elements, ignores any further change in the gravitational interactions, and overshoots after shell-crossing (see the lower left panel of figure \ref{fig:Eulerian}). However, even though the Zel'dovich approximation no-longer accurately predicts the location of the multi-stream regions and the density field, it does predict the locations and times at which mass elements undergo shell-crossing and form caustics in Lagrangian space at these late times (see the lower right panel). The fold curves provide an reasonable approximation of the boundaries of the multi-stream regions. The cusp curves neatly bisect the multi-stream regions and form knots in the clusters of the cosmic web. Note that a cluster rarely consists of a single cluster caustics. Caustic correlated and together form intricate multi-stream regions in the knots. The filaments evolve more linearly and can often be associated to an unique cusp curve.

%The multi-stream regions of the cosmic web forms gradually. Its evolution is neatly captured by the dynamics of the caustic skeleton (see figure \ref{fig:Eulerian_Evolution}). At early times, the dark-matter sheet consisted of a single single-stream region. As the mass elements undergo gravitational collapse, we observe the formation of several Zel'dovich pancakes corresponding to the maxima of the eigenvalue field $\lambda_1$ (see the upper left panel). These multi-stream regions grow and connect at the saddle points of the eigenvalue fields to form the web-like structure we observe in redshift surveys (see the upper right and lower panels). Note that viralized filaments move coherently while the large voids expand and the smaller voids contract. In this process several filaments may  merge to form more massive structures.

%\section{The caustic skeleton in Lagangian space}\label{sec:Caustic_Skeleton_Theory}
%In the previous section, we describe the gravitationally collapse of Gaussian fluctuations leading to the formation of an intricate cosmic network, known as the cosmic web. This web -- consisting of voids, walls, filaments and clusters -- is intimately tied to the development of multi-stream regions, which in turn are most naturally described in terms of caustics. These caustics capture the formation histories of the multi-stream regions and trace the spine of the cosmic web. Moreover, we point out a strong correspondence between the geometry of the eigenvalue fields of the initial deformation tensor (governed by the gravitational potential) and the geometry of the web at late times. In the present section, we develop the mathematical formalism underlying these observations. In particular, we briefly summarize the work presented in our previous paper on the caustic skeleton of the cosmic web \cite{Feldbrugge:2018}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Lagrangian fluid dynamics}
There exist multiple ways to model the gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in an expanding universe. The most well-known formalism is the Eulerian approach, in which one studies the evolution of the density, the velocity, and the gravitational potential fields of the dark matter fluid, governed by the conservation of mass, the Euler, and the Poisson equations. The formalism is relatively concise, and leads to a reasonably accurate description of the mean flow in a large fraction of space. However, the formalism has certain limitations as it generally assigns a unique value for the density and velocity to each point in space, and fails to properly describe the fluid in the multistream regions, where each mass stream has its own distinct density and velocity.

The multi-stream regions are more naturally described in the Lagrangian approach, which models the fluid in terms of a collection of mass elements uniformly filling space at the initial time. The evolution of the mass elements is captured by the Lagrangian map $\bm{x}_t:\mathcal{L}\to \mathcal{E}$,
\begin{align}
\bm{x}_t(\bm{q}) = \bm{q} + \bm{s}_t(\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
describing the position of a mass element starting from the position $\bm{q}$ in Lagrangian space $\mathcal{L}$ to the final position $\bm{x}_t(\bm{q})$ at time $t$ in Eulerian space $\mathcal{E}$, with the displacement field $\bm{s}_t(\bm{q})= \bm{x}_t(\bm{q}) - \bm{q}$. Each mass element can flow, stretch, and rotate, while conserving its mass. The density of a Lagrangian fluid is derived from the Lagrangian map through the conservation of mass, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
\rho_t(\bm{x})
&= \sum_{\bm{q} \in A_t(\bm{x})} \frac{\bar{\rho}}{|\det \nabla \bm{x}_t(\bm{q})|}\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{\bm{q} \in A_t(\bm{x})} \frac{\bar{\rho}}{|1+\mu_{t,1}(\bm{q})||1+\mu_{t,2}(\bm{q})|}\,,
\label{eq:density}
\end{align}
with the mean initial density $\bar{\rho}$, and the eigenvalue fields $\mu_{t,1}$ and $\mu_{t,2}$ of the deformation tensor $\nabla \bm{s}_t$, defined by the eigenequation
\begin{align}
\nabla \bm{s}_t(\bm{q}) \bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q}) = \mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}) \bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q})\,,
\label{eq:EigenvalueAndEigenvector}
\end{align} 
with the corresponding eigenvector fields $\bm{v}_{t,1}$, and $\bm{v}_{t,2}$. Each stream contributes to the density, as the sum runs over the points that reach $\bm{x}$ in time $t$, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
A_t(\bm{x}') = \{\bm{q}\,|\,\bm{x}_t(\bm{q})=\bm{x}'\}\,.
\end{align} 
Lagrangian fluid dynamics is well-known to be an effective tool to model the cosmic web, as demonstrated by the famous Zel'dovich approximation \cite{Zeldovich:1970}, second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory ($2$LPT) \cite{Buchert:1992, Buchert:1993a, Buchert:1993b, Buchert:1994a, Buchert:1994b, Bouchet:1995}, and $N$-body simulations \cite{Springel:2005, illustris:2014, eagle:2015, ABACUSSUMMIT:2021, Quijote:2020}. 

A two-dimensional Lagrangian fluid forms a two-dimensional sheet $M_t=\{(\bm{q},\bm{x}_t(\bm{q})) \, |\, \bm{q}\in \mathcal{L}\}$ in four-dimensional \textit{phase-space} $\mathcal{L}\times \mathcal{E}$, consisting of the inital and the final positions of the mass elements. Note that there exists a direct correspondence between this definition of phase-space and the more conventional phase-space consisting of the position and momentum of a particle in Hamiltonian mechanics. The cosmic web emerges in the projection of the phase-space sheet $M_t$ onto the final position $\varphi:\mathcal{L}\times \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E}$, defined by the map $(\bm{q},\bm{x}) \mapsto\bm{x}$ (see figure \ref{fig:Phase-Space} for an illustration).

\end{figure}
Initially, the displacement field vanishes, $\bm{s}_0(\bm{q})=\bm{0}$, and the phase-space manifold is diagonal $M_0=\{(\bm{q},\bm{q})\,|\,\bm{q} \in \mathcal{L}\}$. The mapping $\varphi$ is one-to-one, corresponding to a single-stream region (see the left panel of figure\ \ref{fig:Phase-Space}). When the fluid evolves, the phase-space manifold can develop complex configurations at which the mapping $\varphi$ becomes many-to-one, \textit{i.e.}, a final position can be reached from multiple initial positions. A connected region, in Eulerian space, with $n$ possible initial positions is known as an $n$-stream region (see the triple-stream region in the right panel of figure \ref{fig:Phase-Space}). In these multi-stream regions, gravitational collapse becomes non-linear and viralized structures start to form. The multi-stream regions partition the universe into regions with distinct formation histories, based on the dynamics of gravitational collapse. The fold caustic bound the multi-stream regions. At a fold, the orientation of the mass elements flip in a process known as \textit{shell-crossing}. In this process, the deformation tensor is singular, $\det \nabla \bm{x}_t = 0$, and the density \eqref{eq:density} spikes to infinity. As we will show in the next section, higher-order caustics in multi-stream regions can be associated to the membranes, filaments, and clusters of the cosmic web. The single-stream regions correspond colloquially to the voids, where the evolution of the cosmic web is well described by Eulerian fluid dynamics. For recent investigations on the phase-space structure of the cosmic web and the identification of multi-stream regions in $N$-body simulations see \cite{Hahn:2007, Abel:2012, Shandarin:2012,  Feldbrugge:2014b, Ramachandra:2015, Ramachandra:2017, Shandarin:2019, Shandarin:2021}.

\subsection{Caustics in Lagrangian fluids}
The study of the cosmic web in terms of multi-stream regions and Lagrangian catastrophe theory has a rich history, predating the developments of $N$-body simulations. Amazingly, by analysing the geometry of the caustics emerging in Lagrangian fluid dynamics, Y.\ Zel'dovich, V.\ Arnol'd and collaborators successfully predicted the qualitative features of the cosmic web \cite{Arnold:1982a, Arnold:1982b, Shandarin:1983, Rozhanskii:1984, Shandarin:1989}. The large-scale structure is described in terms of a network of caustics, analogous to the light patterns emerging on the sea bed or the bottom of a swimming pool \cite{Berry:1977, Berry:1980, Feldbrugge:2019}. 

However, these studies where mainly restricted to two-dimensional models, as several technical problems inhibited the full treatment of three-dimensional cosmic web. In a recent publication \cite{Feldbrugge:2018}, we solved these problems by formulating the \textit{shell-crossing condition} describing how a submanifold in $\mathcal{L}$ can develop a non-differentiable feature under the mapping $\bm{x}_t$. Given a submanifold $L \subset \mathcal{L}$, the mapping $\bm{x}_t(L)$ develops a non-differentiable point at time $t$ in $\bm{q}_c$ when there exists a non-zero vector tangent vector $\bm{T}$ in the tangent space of $L$ at $\bm{q}_c$ for which 
\begin{align}
(1+\mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c))\bm{v}_{t,i}^*(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \bm{T}=0
\label{eq:shellCrossingCondition}
\end{align}
for all $i=1,2$, with $\bm{v}_{i,t}^*$ the dual eigenvector field defined by the relation $\bm{v}_{t,i}\cdot \bm{v}_{t,j}^* = \delta_{ij}$. The shell-crossing condition indicates the key role of the eigenvalue $\mu_{t,i}$ and eigenvector fields $\bm{v}_{t,i}$ of the deformation tensor $\nabla \bm{s}_t$ over the density field in the development of multi-stream regions. Note that even at early times, the eigenvalue fields are non-Gaussian and show the web-like structure of the late-time multi-stream regions and mass distribution (see figure \ref{fig:Initial_Conditions}). Furthermore note that not only the eigenvalue fields but also the, often ignored, eigenvector fields (see for example \cite{Forero:2009}) plays a central role the shell-crossing condition and the definition of the higher-order caustics, tracing the filaments and clusters of the cosmic web.

The shell-crossing condition leads to a set of \textit{caustic conditions} describing the properties of the displacement field in the vicinity of the caustic that stably occur in nature (for a derivation of Lagrangian catastrophe theory see \cite{Arnold:1972, Arnold:1976, Poston:1978, Gilmore:1981, Kravtsov:1983, Arnold:1984, Arnold:2012a, Arnold:2012b}). When applying the shell-crossing condition to Lagrangian space, $L=\mathcal{L}$, we obtain the condition for the fold caustic $A_2$,
\begin{align}
1+\mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=0\,,
\end{align}
for $i=1$ or $2$, marking the shell-crossing region at which the density spikes. The fold curve is independent of the eigenvector fields. The fold curve bounds the different multi-stream regions (see the red curves in figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Big}).



The fold curve develops non-differentiable points in the cusp caustic $A_3$, when the fold curve in Lagrangian space is parallel to the corresponding eigenvector field, \textit{i.e.}, 
\begin{align}
1+\mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=0\,,\\
\bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla \mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=0\,.\label{eq:cuspCondition}
\end{align}
See the intersection of the red and blue curves in figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Big}, where the tangent vector of the red line is parallel to the eigenvector field. The term $\bm{v}_{t,i} \cdot \nabla \mu_{t,i}$ arises in the shell-crossing condition \eqref{eq:shellCrossingCondition} with $L=A_2$, from the observation that the tangent vector of the fold curve $\bm{T}$ is normal to the gradient of the eigenvalue field $\nabla \mu_{t,i}$. Over time, the cusp point defines the cusp curve which is associated to the filaments of the cosmic web. See the blue curve in the first row of figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Big} for an example of a fold curve and its relation to the filaments of the cosmic web. 

In turn, the cusp curve develops a non-differentiable point known as a swallowtail caustic $A_4$ when the cusp curve in Lagrangian space is parallel to the eigenvector field, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
1+\mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=0\,,\\
\bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla \mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=0\,,\\
\bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla \mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)) = 0\,.
\end{align}
The swallowtail caustic only exists for an instance in time and marks the location of a cluster, highlighting the location where different cusp curves join (see the second row of figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Big}). 

In addition to the swallowtail caustic, the Lagrangian fluid also develops point-like caustics when both eigenvalue fields lead to a spike in the density field. The points for which
\begin{align}
1+\mu_{t,1}(\bm{q}_c) =0\,,\\
1+\mu_{t,2}(\bm{q}_c) = 0\,,
\end{align}
are known as the umbilic caustics $D_4^\pm$. The umbilic caustics consist of the elliptic $D_4^+$ and hyperbolic caustics $D_4^-$, both related to the clusters of the cosmic web. The umbilic caustics mark the locations where the cusp curves corresponding to the first and the second eigenvalue fields join (see the third and fourth rows of figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Big}).

Finally, caustic skeleton theory includes a set of Morse points, at which the multi-stream regions emerge, vanish and merge, changing the topology and connectivity of the cosmic web. The Morse points are defined as the critical points of the eigenvalue fields, satisfying the condition
\begin{align}
\nabla \mu_{t,i}(\bm{q}_c)=\bm{0}\,.
\end{align}
A critical point that undergoes shell-crossing always lies on a cusp curves, as a point with a vanishing gradient automatically satisfies equation \eqref{eq:cuspCondition}. The maxima and minima of the eigenvalue field $\mu_i$, known as $A_3^+$ points, mark the locations and times at which a multi-stream region forms or vanishes. The saddle point of the eigenvalue field $\mu_{t,i}$, known as $A_3^-$ points, mark the location and time at which two multi-stream regions merge to form a larger structure. The Morse points $A_3^-$ determine the connectivity of the cosmic web. We summarize the different elements of the caustic skeleton in table \ref{table:caustics}. For a complete contemporary description of caustic skeleton theory, we refer to \cite{Hidding:2014, Feldbrugge:2018}. 

See figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Small} for a zoom in of the various caustics in the Zel'dovich approximation and the $N$-body simulation. The fold line nicely bounds the multi-stream regions. The cusp curve bisects the multi-stream regions tracing the filaments. The swallowtail caustic and the umbilic caustics mark the knots where the filaments merge. Note that the caustic skeleton is evaluated for the Zel'dovich approximation and pushed to Eulerian space with either the Zel'dovich approximation or the $N$-body simulation. It is for this reason not surprising that the fold curve does not exactly match the shell-crossing region of the $N$-body simulation. Nevertheless, the caustics of the Zel'dovich approximation are very close to the caustics emerging in the fully non-linear model. Finally, note that the cluster caustics are in practice rarely isolated. The caustics cluster and together form more intricate multi-stream structure. This way, a cluster can connect more than three filaments, even though the swallowtail, and umbilic caustics individually connect only three filament regions.\\




The study of the Morse points of the caustic skeleton has a direct connection to the DisPerSE and the Felix classification schemes \cite{Pogosyan:2009, Sousbie:2011a, Sousbie:2011b, Shivashankar:2016}, which apply Morse-Smale theory to the density field. In this scheme, the critical points of the density field connect the maxima via integral lines, which are associated to the filaments of the cosmic web. However, the caustic skeleton differs from Morse-Smale theory in several respects. Firstly, in this paper, we focus on the deformation tensor instead of the density field. The eigenvalue fields are non-Gaussian tie into the dynamics of gravitational collapse. See figure \ref{fig:critical} for a comparison of the critical point densities of the initial density perturbation and the eigenvalue fields in the Zel'dovich approximation (see section \ref{sec:Zeldovich} for details). Secondly, the threshold of the the caustic skeleton is determined by the cosmic time (the growing mode for the Zel'dovich approximation). Finally, rather than connecting saddle points and maxima via integral lines satisfying a differential equation, the caustic skeleton connects the critical points using the simpler level sets \eqref{eq:cuspCondition} corresponding to the cusp caustic.

\subsection{The Zel'dovich approximation}\label{sec:Zeldovich}
In this paper we define the caustic skeleton using the Zel'dovich approximation \cite{Zeldovich:1970} and study the resulting structures using a dark matter $N$-body simulation \cite{Hidding:2020}. The Zel'dovich approximation is the first order approximation in Lagrangian fluid dynamics, for which the displacement field factorizes into a spatial and a temporal part
\begin{align}
\bm{s}_t(\bm{q}) = - b_+(t) \nabla_{\bm{q}} \Psi(\bm{q})\,.
\end{align}
The growing mode $b_+(t)$ is a natural time parameter, increasing monotonically, satisfying the differential equation
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 b_+(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2 \frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)} \frac{\mathrm{d} b_+(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = 4 \pi G \rho_u(t) b_+(t)\,,
\end{align}
in terms of the scale factor $a$, the mean density $\rho_u = \langle \rho \rangle$, and Newton's gravitaitonal constant $G$. The displacement potential $\Psi$ captures the geometry of the cosmic web
\begin{align}
\Psi(\bm{q}) &=\frac{1}{4 \pi G a^2 \rho_0}\phi_0(\bm{q})%\\
%&= \frac{2}{3\Omega_0 H_0^2}\phi_0(\bm{q})
\,,
\end{align}
expressed in terms of the current total energy density %$\Omega_0$ and
$\rho_0$,
%the current Hubble parameter $H_0$,
and the linearly extrapolated gravitational potential $\phi_0$. The Poisson equation relates the primordial gravitational potential to the primordial density perturbation
\begin{align}
\nabla ^2 \phi_0 &= 4 \pi G a^2 \rho_u \delta_0\,,%\\
%&= \frac{3}{2} \Omega H^2 a^2 \delta\,,
\end{align}
with the dimensionless density contrast
\begin{align}
\delta(\bm{q}) = \frac{\rho(\bm{q})}{\rho_u} -1\,.
\end{align}
When working with the Zel'dovich approximation, it is convenient to work in terms of the Hessian of the displacement potential,
\begin{align}
\bm{\psi}=\mathcal{H}\Psi\,,
\end{align}
and the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ and $\bm{v}_i$
\begin{align}
\bm{\psi}\bm{v}_i = \lambda_i \bm{v}_i\,,
\end{align} 
at early times satisfying the relation $\lambda_1 =-\mu_2/b_+,\lambda_2 =-\mu_1/b_+$. For convenience, we will assume the ordering $\lambda_1(\bm{q}) \geq \lambda_2(\bm{q})$ such that the first collapse corresponds to the first eigenvalue field $\lambda_1$. In terms of the eigenvalue fields $\lambda_i$, the density takes the form 
\begin{align}
\rho_t(\bm{x})
&= \sum_{\bm{q} \in A_t(\bm{x})} \frac{\bar{\rho}}{|1-b_+(t) \lambda_1(\bm{q})||1-b_+(t) \lambda_2(\bm{q})|}\,.
\end{align}
Initially, the growing mode $b_+$ vanishes and the universe consists of a single-stream region. As the fluid collapses under self gravity, the growing mode $b_+$ increases. The fold caustics form at the level sets of the eigenvalue field $\{\bm{q}\,|\,\lambda_i(\bm{q})=1/b_+(t)\}$. From this picture we observe the direct connection between the critical points of the eigenvalue fields and the connectivity of the cosmic web through Morse theory.

As described in the previous section, the eigenvalue field of the deformation tensor are non-Gaussian. From the Poisson equation, it follows that the sum of the eigenvalue fields is proportional to the initial density contrast $\lambda_1+\lambda_2 \propto \delta_0$ and the joint probability distribution is given by the two-dimensional Doroshkevich formula \cite{Doroshkevich:1970, Feldbrugge:2014}
\begin{align}
p(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\pi} \sigma_2^3} e^{-\frac{3(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)^2-8\lambda_1 \lambda_2}{2 \sigma_2^2}}|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|\,,
\end{align}
(see figure \ref{fig:eigen_stats}), with $\sigma_2$ the generalized moment defined in section \ref{sec:GRF}.


The Zel'dovich approximation describes the evolution of mass elements in terms of balistic motion. The mass elements follow linear trajectories determined by the primordial gravitational potential. The approximation accurately describes single-stream regions at early times but fails at late times in multi-stream regions when gravitational backreaction of the mass elements becomes important (see the lower left panel of \ref{fig:Eulerian}). Even though the distribution of the mass elements is not accurately described at late times, we find that the approximation does reliably describe the formation of caustics in the non-linear evolution of the cosmic web. In this paper, we will always work with the caustic skeleton of the Zeld'dovich approximation in Lagrangian space. We subsequently move the skeleton to Eulerian space with either the Zel'dovich approximation or an $N$-body simulation. For this reason, the skeleton does not absolutely match the shell-crossing regions in the $N$-body simulations. However, it turns out to be a good first approximation (see for example figure \ref{fig:caustics_Examples_Small}).

\section{Constrained random field theory}\label{sec:GRF}
One of the most startling realizations in modern cosmology is that the intricate cosmic web, observed in several cosmological redshift surveys, originated from extremely simple initial conditions. At the moment of recombination, when the baryons and electrons form neutral elements and decouple from the photons, the energy density in our universe, was extremely homogeneous with only tiny density fluctuations. The imprints of these fluctuations have over the last decades been measured with increasing accuracy in the temperature maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background field (CMB) \cite{WMAP:2003, Planck:2016}. Several contemporary paradigms for the big bang, such as inflation theory, envisage these fluctuations to have a quantum origin and interpret them as a realization of a Gaussian random field with only small non-Gaussian deviations. This is in accordance with the most recent statistical analyses of the CMB \cite {Creminelli:2006, Planck:2020} and forms the underpinning of the study of the cosmic web. In this section, we will give a concise definition of Gaussian random field theory. We discuss the implementation of linear constraint Gaussian random field theory, following the notation presented in \cite{Weygaert:1996}, and extend these conditions to non-linear constraints. This will allow us to efficiently implement the caustic conditions and study the properties of the emerging structures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gaussian random fields}
A two-dimensional Gaussian random field $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ is a generalization of a multi-dimensional normal distribution to the continuum, defined by the probability density
\begin{align}
p(f) = \mathcal{N} e^{- S[f]}\,, \label{eq:functional_Distribution}
\end{align}
with the normalization constant $\mathcal{N}$ and the `action' (in analogy with the Euclidean path integral \cite{Feynman:1965})
\begin{align}
S[f]\equiv \frac{1}{2} \iint [f(\bm{q}_1) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_1)] K(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2) [f(\bm{q}_2) -\bar{f}(\bm{q}_2)]\mathrm{d}\bm{q}_1 \mathrm{d}\bm{q}_2,\label{eq:action}
\end{align}
defined in terms of the mean field $\bar{f}(\bm{q})$ and the kernel $K(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2)$ \cite{Longuet-Higgins:1957, Adler:1981, bbks:1986}. The probability that the random field $f$ is included in a set of functions $\mathcal{S}$ is defined by the path integral
\begin{align}
P[f \in \mathcal{S}] = \mathcal{N} \int \bm{1}_\mathcal{S}(f) e^{-S[f]}\,\mathcal{D}f\,,
\end{align}
with $\bm{1}_\mathcal{S}$ the identity function\footnote{Defined by $\bm{1}_\mathcal{S}(x)=1$ when $x \in \mathcal{S}$ and $\bm{1}_\mathcal{S}(x)=0$ when $x \notin \mathcal{S}$.} and $\mathcal{D}f$ the path integral measure. The expectation value of a functional $Q[f]$ is given by
\begin{align}
\left\langle Q[f] \right\rangle = \mathcal{N}\int Q[f]\, e^{-S[f]}\,\mathcal{D}f\,,
\end{align}
analogous to the Euclidean path integrals in statistical field theory. It can be shown that the expectation value of the Gaussian random field is given by the mean field
\begin{align}
\langle f(\bm{q})\rangle &= \bar{f}(\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
and that the two-point correlation function
\begin{align}
\xi(\bm{q}_1, \bm{q}_2) &= \langle (f(\bm{q}_1) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_1)) (f(\bm{q}_2) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_2))\rangle\nonumber\\
&= \int (f(\bm{q}_1) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_1)) (f(\bm{q}_2) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_2)) e^{-S[f]}\mathcal{D}f
\end{align}
is the inverse of the kernel $K$, \textit{i.e.,}
\begin{align}
\int K(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}) \xi(\bm{q},\bm{q}_2) \mathrm{d}\bm{q}= \delta_D^{(2)}(\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2)\,,\label{eq:defK}
\end{align}
with the two-dimensional Dirac delta function $\delta_D^{(2)}$. The Gaussian random field is thus fully determined by the mean field $\bar{f}$ and the two-point correlation function $\xi$. 

In cosmology, the cosmological principle often leads to the study of statistically homogeneous and isotropic random fields for which the mean field is constant $\bar{f}(\bm{q})=\bar{f}=0$ and the two-point correlation function only depends on the magnitude of the difference of the inserted points, \textit{i.e.}, $\xi(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2)=\xi(\|\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2\|)$, and consequently $K(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2)=K(\|\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2\|)$. In the present paper, we work with statistically homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random fields. However, the theory generalizes to generic Gaussian random fields.

The statistical properties of homogeneous and isotropic random fields are most transparently expressed in terms of the Fourier transform of the random field
\begin{align}
\hat{f}(\bm{k}) = \int f(\bm{q})e^{i\bm{k}\cdot \bm{q}}\mathrm{d}\bm{q}\,,
\end{align}
and the inverse transform
\begin{align}
f(\bm{q}) = \int \hat{f}(\bm{k})e^{-i \bm{k} \cdot \bm{q}}\frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}}{(2\pi)^2}\,.
\end{align}
The Fourier modes of real-valued Gaussian random fields satisfy the reality condition $\hat{f}(\bm{k}) = \hat{f}^*(-\bm{k})$. Using the double convolution theorem, we express the action \eqref{eq:action} as
\begin{align}
S[f] = \frac{1}{2} \int |\hat{f}(\bm{k})|^2 \hat{K}(\bm{k}) \frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}}{(2\pi)^2}\,.
\end{align}
In Fourier space, equation \eqref{eq:defK} takes the form
\begin{align}
\int \hat{K}(\bm{k})\, P(\bm{k})\, e^{i\bm{k}(\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2)} \frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}}{(2\pi)^2} = \delta_D^{(2)}(\bm{q}_1 - \bm{q}_2)\,,
\end{align}
with the power spectrum defined as the Fourier transform of the two-point correclation function,
\begin{align}
P(\bm{k}) = \int \xi(\bm{q}) \, e^{i\bm{k}\cdot \bm{q}}\mathrm{d}\bm{q}\,,
\end{align}
implying the relation $\hat{K}(\bm{k}) = 1/P(\bm{k})$. For a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random field $P(\bm{k})=P(\|\bm{k}\|)$. The resulting probability density of the Fourier modes is diagonal
\begin{align}
p(\hat{f}) \propto \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{|\hat{f}(\bm{k})|^2}{P(\bm{k})} \frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}}{(2\pi)^2}\right]\,,
\end{align}
implying the covariance
\begin{align}
\langle \hat{f}(\bm{k}_1)\hat{f}^*(\bm{k}_2) \rangle = (2\pi)^2 \delta_D^{(2)}(\bm{k}_1-\bm{k}_2) P(\bm{k}_1)\,.
\end{align}

%\begin{framed}
%In this paper, we for simplicity always assume the initial gravitational potential to be a realization of a homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random field with a power-law power spectrum $P(k) \propto k^{n_s}$ smoothed with a Gaussian filter $W(k)=e^{-R_s^2 k^2/2}$ with the spectral index $n_s$ and the smoothing scale $R_s$. The effective power spectrum takes the form 
%\begin{align}
%P_{eff}(k)\propto k^{ns}e^{-R_s^2 k^2}\,.
%\end{align}
%Unless otherwise specified, we use a spectral index $n_s=-1$ and a smoothing length scale $R_s = 5\text{ Mpc}$. 
%\end{framed}


In practice, we often consider realizations of Gaussian random fields on a lattice, or more generally a finite set of linear statistics $\bm{Y}=(Y_1,Y_2,\dots,Y_M)$. In this setting, the functional distribution \eqref{eq:functional_Distribution} reduces to the multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution,
\begin{align}
p(\bm{Y}) = \frac{\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}  \Delta \bm{Y}^T M^{-1} \Delta \bm{Y}\right]}{[(2\pi)^n \det M]^{1/2}}\,,
\end{align}
with the deviation from the mean $\Delta \bm{Y} = \bm{Y} - \langle \bm{Y}\rangle$ and the covariance matrix
\begin{align}
M = \text{cov}(\bm{Y},\bm{Y}) = \langle \Delta \bm{Y}^T \Delta \bm{Y}\rangle\,.
\end{align}
The distribution of the discrete Fourier modes $\bm{Y}=(\hat{f}(\bm{k}_1),\hat{f}(\bm{k}_2),\dots)$ takes the form 
\begin{align}
p(\hat{f}(\bm{k}_1), \hat{f}(\bm{k}_2), \dots) = \prod_{i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi P( \bm{k}_i)}} \exp\left[-\frac{|\hat{f}(\bm{k}_i)|^2}{2P(\bm{k}_i)}\right],
\end{align}
yielding an efficient method to generate realizations (see appendix \ref{ap:GRF}).

The statistical properties of random fields are often conveniently expressed in terms of the moments
\begin{align}
\sigma_i^2 &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \int \|\bm{k}\|^{2i}P(\bm{k})\mathrm{d}\bm{k}\nonumber\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^\infty k^{2i+1}P(k)\mathrm{d}k\,,
\end{align}
with the magnitude $k = \|\bm{k}\|$. The power spectrum determines the covariance matrix $M$ through these moments. Whereas the variance of the random field is given by the moment $\sigma_0^2$, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
\langle f(\bm{q})^2 \rangle &= \iint e^{i (\bm{p} - \bm{k})\cdot \bm{q}} \langle \hat{f}(\bm{k})\hat{f}^*(\bm{p})\rangle \frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}\mathrm{d}\bm{p}}{(2\pi)^4}\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\int P(\bm{k})\mathrm{d}\bm{k}=\sigma_0^2\,,
\end{align}
the expectation value of the square of the norm of the gradient takes the form
\begin{align}
\langle \|\nabla f(\bm{q})\|^2\rangle &= \langle \partial_1f(\bm{q})^2 + \partial_2 f(\bm{q})^2 \rangle \nonumber \\
&= \iint [(ik_1)(-ip_1)+(ik_2)(-ip_2)] e^{i (\bm{p} - \bm{k})\cdot \bm{q}} \langle \hat{f}(\bm{k})\hat{f}^*(\bm{p})\rangle \frac{\mathrm{d}\bm{k}\mathrm{d}\bm{p}}{(2\pi)^4}\nonumber \\
&=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\int \|\bm{k}\|^2 P(\bm{k})\mathrm{d}\bm{k}=\sigma_1^2\,,
\end{align}
with $\bm{k}=(k_1,k_2)$ and $\bm{p}=(p_1,p_2)$. By statistical isotropy, we obtain the variance of the first order partial derivatives
\begin{align}
\langle \partial_1 f(\bm{q})^2\rangle =\langle \partial_2 f(\bm{q})^2\rangle =\frac{\sigma_1^2}{2}\,.
\end{align}

\subsection{Linear constraints: Gaussian fields}
In this paper, we study how the different geometric features of the cosmic web emerge from different initial conditions. To systematically study these initial conditions we use constrained Gaussian random field theory \cite{Bertschinger:1987, Hoffman:1991, Sheth:1995, Weygaert:1996}. In this section, we develop the theory of linear constraints following the analysis of \cite{Weygaert:1996}. In the next section, we generalize this theory to a large class of non-linear constraints. %We restrict both discussions to statistically homogeneous and isotropic fields with vanishing mean.

For a random field $f$, consider a set of linear constraints
\begin{align}
\Gamma =\{ C_i[f;\bm{q}_i] = c_i,\,\ i=1,\dots,M \}\,,
\end{align}
with the linear functional $C_i[f;\bm{q}]$ assuming the value $c_i$ in $\bm{q}_i$. A linear functional can take the form of the function value at a point
\begin{align}
C[f;\bm{q}'] &= f(\bm{q}')\,,
\end{align}
its derivative at a point
\begin{align}
C[f;\bm{q}'] &= \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i}f(\bm{q}')\,,
\end{align}
or more generally a convolution
\begin{align}
C[f;\bm{q}'] &= \int g(\bm{q}' - \bm{q})f(\bm{q})\mathrm{d}\bm{q}\,,
\end{align}
with the convolution kernel $g$. 

The constraint random field follows the distribution
\begin{align}
p(f|\Gamma) = \frac{p(f,\Gamma)}{p(\Gamma)}\,,
\end{align}
where the constraints follow the Gaussian marginal distribution
\begin{align}
p(\Gamma) = \frac{\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \Delta\bm{C}^T Q^{-1} \Delta\bm{C} \right]}{[(2\pi)^M \det Q]^{1/2}}\,,
\end{align}
with the vector $\bm{C}=(C_1[f;\bm{q}_1], \dots, C_M[f;\bm{q}_M])$ and the covariance matrix $Q = \text{cov}(\bm{C}, \bm{C})$. We can write the constraint distribution as the Gaussian probability density
\begin{align}
p(f|\Gamma) \propto  \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left[\iint f(\bm{q}_1) K(\|\bm{q}_1 - \bm{q}_2\|) f(\bm{q}_2)\mathrm{d}\bm{q}_1 \mathrm{d}\bm{q}_2 -\Delta \bm{C}^TQ^{-1}\Delta \bm{C}\right]\right],\label{eq:constraint1}
\end{align}
in the space of functions satisfying the constraints $\Gamma$. In appendix \ref{ap:constraintDensity}, we derive the mean field
\begin{align}
\bar{f}_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q})&=\langle f(\bm{q})|\Gamma\rangle \nonumber \\
&= \bar{f}(\bm{q}) + \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i (\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}(c_j-\bar{C}_j)\,,
\end{align}
and the covariance
\begin{align}
\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1),f(\bm{q}_2)|\Gamma)  = \xi(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2) - \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q}_1)\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q}_2)\,,
\end{align}
with the covariance of the random field and the constraints $\xi_{i}(\bm{q}) = \text{cov}( f(\bm{q}), C_i)$ and the covariance matrix of the constraints $\xi_{ij} = \text{cov}( C_i ,C_j)$. Note that the covariance is independent of the value $\bm{c}$ the constraint $\bm{C}$ assumes. This is a special property of Gaussian distributions and linear constraints. Consequently, the probability density takes the form
\begin{align}
p( f|\Gamma) \propto  \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \iint \delta{f}(\bm{q}_1) \tilde{K}(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2) \delta f(\bm{q}_2)\mathrm{d}\bm{q}_1 \mathrm{d}\bm{q}_2 \right]\,,\label{eq:constraint2}
\end{align}
with the residue $\delta f = f-\langle f(\bm{q})|\Gamma\rangle$ and the constrained kernel $\tilde{K}$ defined as the inverse of the constrained two-point correlation function, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
\int \tilde{K}(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}) \left[\xi(\bm{q},\bm{q}_2) - \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q}_2)\right]\mathrm{d}\bm{q}= \delta_D^{(2)}(\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2)\,.
\end{align}
Note that earlier papers \cite{Bertschinger:1987, Hoffman:1991, Sheth:1995, Weygaert:1996} worked in the space of functions satisfying the constraints $\Gamma$, neglecting the correction $\sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q}_2)$, and using the original kernel $K$ for the residue. In this study, we prefer to work in space of unrestricted functions, as the correction makes the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the residue manifest. These properties are most clearly observed in the variance of the residue,
\begin{align}
\langle \delta f(\bm{q})^2|\Gamma \rangle = \sigma_0^2- \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q})\,,\label{eq:variance_Linear}
\end{align}
which vanishes on the constraints. Away from the constraints, the variance of the residue approaches the variance of the unconstrained  field $\text{var}(f)=\sigma_0^2$. Note that this relation implies an analogous relation for the Laplacian of the random field $\nabla^2 f$, \textit{i.e.}, we find the mean
\begin{align}
\langle \nabla^2 f(\bm{q})\,|\,\Gamma\rangle = \nabla^2 f_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q})
\end{align}
and the variance
\begin{align}
\langle \delta (\nabla^2f(\bm{q}_1))^2\,|\,\Gamma \rangle = \sigma_2^2- \sum_{i,j=1}^M\nabla^2\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\nabla^2\xi_j(\bm{q})\,.\label{eq:variance_Linear_Laplace}
\end{align}


The Hoffman-Ribak method cleverly uses the property that the statistics of the residue $\delta f$ are independent of $\bm{c}$, to generate realizations of the constraint Gaussian random field \cite{Hoffman:1991, Weygaert:1996}. Firstly, generate a realization $g$ of the unconstraint Gaussian random field with the required power spectrum. Secondly, evaluate the constraints for this realization $C_i[g;\bm{q}'_i]=d_i$ and the corresponding mean field $\bar{g}$. The statistical properties of the residue with respect to this mean field $\delta g = g-\bar{g}$ are independent of the value the constraints assume and thus identical to the properties of the residue $\delta f$. We can thus identify the residue $\delta g$ of the field $g$ with the residue $\delta f$ of the constrained field $f$. By adding the residue of the unconstraint field to the mean field with the required constraints, we obtain the realization of the constrained Gaussian random field. For more details see appendix \ref{ap:GRF}.

To judge the relevance of a particular set of constraints, it is useful to evaluate the $\chi^2$ of the set of values $c_i$,
\begin{align}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^M (c_i-\bar{C}_i)\, \xi_{ij}^{-1}(c_j-\bar{C}_j)\,,
\end{align}
which follows the chi-squared distribution with $M$ degrees of freedom. This is the Mahalanobis distance. The probability that one obtains a $\chi^2$ higher than this value in an unconstrained Gaussian random field, with the same power spectrum, is given by $\Gamma\left(\frac{M}{2}, \frac{\chi^2}{2}\right)/\Gamma\left(\frac{M}{2}\right)$, with the gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ and the upper incomoplete gamma function $\Gamma(s,x)$.

\subsection{Non-linear constraints: formalism}
For the systematic investigation of the caustic skeleton, we extend constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear constraints. More specifically, we extend the theory of linear constraints to the large class of non-linear constraints expressed in terms of a finite number of linear statistics.

Consider the set of linear functionals $C_i[f,\bm{q}_i]$ with $i=1,\dots,M$ and the space of values $\bm{c}=(c_1,\dots,c_M)$ the linear functionals can assume $\mathbb{R}^M$. On this space, we define a set of functions $\mathcal{C}_i:\mathbb{R}^M \to \mathbb{R}$ with $i=1,\dots,N$ and $N\leq M$, and the non-linear constraint $\Gamma = \{\mathcal{C}_i(\bm{C}) = 0\}_{i=1}^N$. We can visualize this geometrically by considering the $(M-N)$-dimensional constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$ in the space of the $M$ linear constraints
\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}} = 
\{\bm{c}\, |\, \mathcal{C}_i(\bm{c}) = 0 \text{ for all } i=1,\dots,N\}.
\end{align}
See figure \ref{fig:constraintManifold} for a sketch of this constraint manifold. On the manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$, the constraint probability density is proportional to the original Gaussian distribution
\begin{framed}
\begin{align}
p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})  = \frac{p(\bm{c})}{\int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} p(\bm{c})\, \mathrm{d}\bm{c}}\,.
\end{align}
\end{framed}
Note that the curvature of $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$ generally makes the induced density $p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})$ non-Gaussian. We extend constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear constraints by studying the finite-dimensional probability density $p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})$:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The problem of generating realizations of the more general constraints fields is reduced to sampling realizations of the distribution $p(\bm{c}|\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})$. Given a sample $\bm{c}$, we use the Hoffman-Ribak method to generate the realization.


\begin{framed}
\item
The mean field of the constrained field assumes the surprisingly suggestive form 
\begin{align}
\bar{f}_{\mathcal{C}}(\bm{q}) =\bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}(\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
with the mean constraint
\begin{align}
\bar{\bm{c}} &\equiv \langle \bm{c} \,|\, \Gamma\rangle = \int_{\bm{c} \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}}  \bm{c}\, p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}) \mathrm{d}\bm{c}\,,
\end{align}
\end{framed}
following from the realization  
\begin{align}
\bar{f}_{\mathcal{C}}(\bm{q}) 
&=\left\langle f(\bm{q})\,|\,\Gamma\right \rangle \nonumber\\
&= \int_{\bm{c} \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}} \bar{f}_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q})\, p(\bm{c}|\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}) \mathrm{d}\bm{c}\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1}\int_{\bm{c} \in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}}  (c_j-\bar{C}_j)\, p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}}) \mathrm{d}\bm{c}\nonumber\\
&= \sum_{i,j=1}^M \xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1} (\bar{c}_j-\bar{C}_j)\nonumber\\
&= \bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}(\bm{q})\,.
\end{align}

\begin{framed}
\item
The residue $\delta f = f - \bar{f}_{\mathcal{C}}$ is generically no longer a Gaussian random field. The variance of the residue yields
\begin{align}
\left \langle \delta f (\bm{q})^2\,|\,\Gamma\right\rangle =
\sigma_0^2 - \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q}) \zeta_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q}) 
\,,\label{eq:variance_Nonlinear}
\end{align}
with the coefficients
\begin{align}
\zeta_{ij}^{-1}= \xi_{ij}^{-1}-\sum_{k,l=1}^M\xi_{ik}^{-1}\text{cov}(c_k, c_l\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})\xi_{lj}^{-1}\,,
\end{align}
\end{framed}
where $\text{cov}(c_j, c_l\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})$ captures the geometry of the constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$, following directly from
\begin{align}
\left \langle \delta f (\bm{q})^2\,|\,\Gamma\right\rangle 
&= \int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} \langle (f(\bm{q})-\bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}(\bm{q}))^2\,|\,C_i[f,\bm{q}_i]=c_i\rangle p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})\mathrm{d}\bm{c}\nonumber \\
&= \int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} \langle f^2(\bm{q})\,|\,C_i[f,\bm{q}_i]=c_i\rangle p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})\mathrm{d}\bm{c} - \bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}^2(\bm{q})\nonumber \\
&= \int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} \langle (f(\bm{q})-\bar{f}_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q}))^2\,|\,C_i[f,\bm{q}_i]=c_i\rangle p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})\mathrm{d}\bm{c} \nonumber \\
&\ \ +\int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} (\bar{f}_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q})- \bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}(\bm{q}))^2p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})\mathrm{d}\bm{c} \nonumber \\
&=  \sigma_0^2 - \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q}) + \sum_{i,j,k,l=1}^M \xi_{i}(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\text{cov}(c_j, c_l\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})\xi_{lk}^{-1}\xi_{k}(\bm{q})\nonumber\\
&=
\sigma_0^2 - \sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q}) \zeta_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\int_{\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}} (\bar{f}_{\bm{c}}(\bm{q})- \bar{f}_{\bar{\bm{c}}}(\bm{q}))^2p(\bm{c}\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C}})\mathrm{d}\bm{c} 
&= \text{var}\left(\sum_{i,j=1}^M\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}c_j\,|\,\bm{c}\in \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}\right)\\
&=\sum_{i,j,k,l=1}^M \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\text{cov}(c_j,c_k\,|\,\bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})\xi_{kl}^{-1}\xi_l(\bm{q})\,.\nonumber
\end{align}
Note that the variance of the residue with respect to the non-linear constraint is no longer independent of the values the constraint assumes. When $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$ consists of a point, we recover the linear formula.
\end{itemize}

A similar relation applies to the Laplacian of the random field, which in our context represents the density perturbations. Following an analogous derivation, we obtain the mean
\begin{align}
\langle \nabla^2 f(\bm{q})\,|\,\Gamma\rangle = \sum_{i,j=1}^M \nabla^2\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}(\bar{c}_j-\bar{C}_j)
\end{align}
and the variance
\begin{align}
\langle \delta (\nabla^2 f(\bm{q}))\,|\,\Gamma\rangle = \sigma_2^2 - \sum_{i,j=1}^M \nabla^2 \xi_i(\bm{q})\zeta_{ij}^{-1}\nabla^2\xi_j(\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
with the same $\bar{\bm{c}}$ and $\zeta_{ij}$.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Non-linear constraints: case study}
A good example of a non-linear constraint is the requirement that the gradient of the Gaussian random field has a unit norm $\|\nabla f(\bm{q}_c)\|=1$. For this condition, we consider the space of first order derivatives
\begin{align}
\bm{C}=(\partial_x f, \partial_y f)\,,
\end{align}
and the non-linear constraint 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{C}(\bm{C})=\partial_x f^2 +  \partial_y f^2 - 1=0\,.
\end{align}
The constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}=\{(\partial_xf,\partial_yf)\, |\, \partial_xf^2+\partial_yf^2=1\}$ is the unit circle in the space of first order derivatives (see figure \ref{fig:constraintManifold_example}).

For a statistically isotropic Gaussian random field, the constrained probability density is uniform $p(\bm{c}\, |\, \bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}) = 1/(2\pi)$. After sampling from the constraint manifold, we construct a corresponding realization using linear constrained Gaussian random field theory. Both the mean and the covariance of the constraint value with respect to the constraint manifold vanish.

When the Gaussian random field is not statistically isotropic, the constraint density $p(\bm{c}\, |\, \bm{c}\in\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})$ is no longer uniformly distributed. We can construct realizations of the constrained Gaussian random field using rejection sampling on the constraint manifold. First, determine the maximum $max$ of $p(\bm{c})$ restricted to $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$. Secondly, generate a uniformly sampled point $\bm{c}$ on the unit circle $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$. Finally, we accept this sample $\bm{c}$ with probability $p(\bm{c})/max$. Once we have sampled the points on the constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$, we again construct a corresponding realization using linear constrained Gaussian random field theory. It is also straightforward to sample the mean and covariance of the constraint value $\bm{c}$ on the constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$.

\section{Constraint initial conditions of the caustic skeleton}\label{sec:caustic_skeleton_constraints}
Given non-linear constrained Gaussian random field theory and the caustic conditions, we study the progenitors of the filaments and clusters in the Zel'dovich approximation. Given the displacement field 
\begin{align}
\bm{s}_t(\bm{q}) = -b_+(t) \nabla_{\bm{q}} \Psi(\bm{q}),
\end{align}
it is convenient to express the deformation tensor
\begin{align}
\bm{\psi}(\bm{q}) = \begin{pmatrix} T_{11}(\bm{q}) & T_{12}(\bm{q}) \\ T_{12}(\bm{q}) & T_{22}(\bm{q})\end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{align}
in terms of the partial derivatives of the displacement potential $T_{ij\dots k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial q_j}\dots \frac{\partial}{\partial q_k}\Psi$. The eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of $\bm{\psi}$ defined by
\begin{align}
\bm{\psi}(\bm{q}) \bm{v}_i(\bm{q}) = \lambda_i(\bm{q}) \bm{v}_i(\bm{q}),
\end{align}
with the ordering $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2$. We normalize the eigenvector field to unity, \textit{i.e.}, $\|\bm{v}_{i}\|=1$. We can express the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields explicitly in terms of the second order derivatives of the deformation potential
\begin{align}
\lambda_{1,2} &= \frac{1}{2}\left[T_{11}+T_{22} \pm \sqrt{4 T_{12}^2+(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}\right]\,,\\
\bm{v}_{1,2} &\propto  \left(T_{11}-T_{22} \pm \sqrt{4 T_{12}^2+(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}, 2 T_{12}\right)\,,
\end{align}
showing their non-linear dependence on the deformation potential.

%In the study below, we assume a power-law power spectrum for the gravitational potential
%\begin{align}
%P(k)=k^{n_s} e^{-R_s^2 \|\bm{k}\|^2}
%\end{align}
%with the spectral index $n_s=-1$ and the Gaussian smoothing at the length scale $R_s = 5 \text{ Mpc}$.

\subsection{Cusp filament}
The cusp caustic forming at time $t$, corresponding to the largest eigenvalue field $\lambda_1$, satisfies the conditions
\begin{align}
b_+(t) \lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) &= 1\,, \\
 \bm{v}_1(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla\lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) &= 0\,.
\end{align}
The orientation of the cusp is determined by the normal vector
\begin{align}
\bm{n} =  \nabla(\bm{v}_1(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla\lambda_1(\bm{q}_c))\,,
\end{align}
which makes an angle 
\begin{align}
\alpha = \text{sign}(\bm{v}_2\cdot \bm{n}) \arccos\left(\frac{|\bm{v}_1\cdot \bm{n}|}{\|\bm{n}\|}\right)
\end{align}
with respect the corresponding eigenvector $\bm{v}_1$. As both the cusp curve and the eigenvector field consist of lines, the angle $\alpha$ assumes a value in the interval $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$. 

In figure \ref{fig:meanCusp}, we plot the mean field of the cusp filament with the condition that centre of the box has a cusp caustic oriented along the vertical direction. The gravitational potential is close to a dipole. The blue central structure yields an inflow of matter, whereas two red structures around the blue structure yield two outflow regions. The critical curve in the eigenvalue field consists of an elongated oval which forms the traditional Zel'dovich pancake in the Zel'dovich approximation. The cusp curve bisects the oval in Lagranian space and the pancake Eulerian space.

On average, the orientation of cusp curve is normal to the eigenvector field $\bm{v}_1$. Figure \ref{fig:alpha} plots the distribution  of the angle $\alpha$. The distribution consists of a bell curve centered at $\alpha =0$ and an exponential fall off towards the angles $\alpha =\pm \pi/2$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Sampling the constraint manifold}
To analyze the constraint field of the cusp caustic, we work in the eigenframe of the deformation tensor for which $\bm{v}_1=(1,0)$ and $\bm{v}_2=(0,1)$. In this frame, the caustic conditions yield a set of linear conditions on the second and third order derivatives of the deformation potential
\begin{align}
T_{11}=1/b_+(t)\,, \quad T_{12}=0\,,\quad T_{22}\leq T_{11}\,,\quad T_{111}=0\,.\label{eq:cusp_cond_1}
\end{align}
The normal vector yields the non-linear form
\begin{align}
\bm{n}=\left(T_{1111} + \frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}, T_{1112} + \frac{3T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\right)\,.\label{eq:cusp_cond_2}
\end{align}
For a derivation of these identities see appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel}.

For simplicity, let's first ignore the orientation of the cusp curve and consider a cusp curve passing through the center of the box, with the relevant linear statistics $Y=(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111})$, whose probability density factorizes into the density of the joint distribution of $T_{11}$ and $T_{22}$ and the one-dimensional Gaussian distributions for $T_{12}$ and $T_{111}$, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
p(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111}) = p(T_{11},T_{22})p(T_{12})p(T_{111})\,.
\end{align}
Generally, two derivatives of a Gaussian random field at a point are independent if and only if they together consist of an odd number of derivatives in either the $q_1$ or the $q_2$ direction. The conditional probability density takes the form
\begin{align}
p&(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111}|,T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+,T_{12}=0,T_{111}=0) \nonumber\\
&= p(T_{22}| T_{22} \leq T_{11}=1/b_+)\nonumber\\
&= \mathcal{N} e^{-\frac{3(T_{11} + T_{22})^2 - 8 T_{11} T_{22}}{2 \sigma_2^2}}\big|_{T_{11}=1/b_+}\,,
\end{align}
with the normalization constant $\mathcal{N}$. After sampling $T_{22}$ from this distribution, we use linear constrained random field theory to obtain the corresponding realization. Note that this procedure is equivalent to generating realizations for the linear constraints $T_{11}=1/b_+,T_{12}=T_{111}=0$ and rejecting realizations for which $T_{22} > 1/b_+$. Give these realizations, it is straightforward to compute the angle $\alpha$ and sample the distribution (see figure \ref{fig:alpha}).

The orientation of the cusp curve is fully characterized by the derivatives  
\begin{align}
Y=(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111},T_{112},T_{122},T_{1111},T_{1112})\,,
\end{align}
with the conditional distribution
\begin{align}
&p(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111},T_{112},T_{122},T_{1111},T_{1112}|T_{22} \leq T_{11}=1/b_+, T_{111}=0)\\
&=
p(T_{11},T_{22},T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+)p(T_{12}T_{1112}|T_{12}=0)p(T_{111},T_{122}|T_{111}=0)p(T_{112})\,.\nonumber
\end{align}
We can generate realizations for which the cusp curve is vertical in the centre of the box, by sampling this distribution with the additional constraint that $\bm{n} \propto (1,0)$. However, for this paper, we will use the a slightly different method based on the sampling method described above. Given an realization, we first evaluate all second, third, and fourth order derivatives and evaluate the angle $\alpha$. Subsequently, rotate these derivatives by an angle $\alpha$ (following appendix \ref{ap:rotations}). The resulting derivatives form a representative sample of a cusp curve running vertical through the centre of the box. By generating a linear constraint realizations with these rotates derivatives, we obtain a realization of the Gaussian random field required cusp curve.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Swallowtail cluster}
The swallowtail caustic forming at time $t$, corresponding to the largest eigenvalue field $\lambda_1$, satisfies the conditions
\begin{align}
b_+(t) \lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) = 1\,,\\
\quad \bm{v}_1(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla\lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) = 0\,,\\
 \quad\bm{v}_1(\bm{q}_c)\cdot \nabla( \bm{v}_1(\bm{q}_c) \cdot \nabla\lambda_1(\bm{q}_c)) = 0\,.
\end{align}
The cusp curve in the swallowtail caustic is parallel to the eigenvector field $\bm{v}_1$ since $\bm{v}_1 \cdot \bm{n}=0$ or equivalently $\alpha = \pm \pi/2$. The swallowtail caustic does not require us to fix its orientation. However, we do need to specify the direction, normal to the fold curve, in which the swallowtail structure forms. We will here use the condition $\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1(\bm{q}) <0$.

In figure \ref{fig:meanSwallowtail}, we plot the mean field of the swallowtail cluster. The gravitational potential is again close to a dipole. However, note the development of an asymmetry with respect to the horizontal axis. The blue central structure yields an inflow of matter, whereas two red structures around the blue structure yield two outflow regions. The critical curve in the eigenvalue field consists of an elongated oval with two bifurcation in the upper half plane. The cusp curves form a trident inside the fold curve. In the Zel'dovich approximation, the caustic skeleton consists of a Zel'dovich pancake with two whiskers in the upper half plane.

\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Sampling the constraint manifold}
In the eigenframe, the caustic conditions for the swallowtail take the form
\begin{align}
T_{11}=1/b_+(t)\,, \quad T_{12}=0\,,\quad T_{22}\leq T_{11}\,,\quad T_{111}=0\,, \quad T_{1111}+\frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}} =0\,.
\end{align}
The condition that specifies the direction in which the swallowtail develops, $\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1  <0$, yields the simple form 
\begin{align}
T_{112} <0\,.
\end{align}
See appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel} for a detailed derivation. 

The swallowtail caustic is determined by the linear statistics $Y=(T_{11},$ $T_{12},$ $T_{22},$ $T_{111},$ $T_{112},$ $T_{1111})$ with the probability density
\begin{align}
p(T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111},T_{112},T_{1111})=p(T_{11},T_{22},T_{1111})p(T_{12})p(T_{111})p(T_{112})\,,
\end{align}
and the constraint distribution 
\begin{align}
&p\left(T_{22},T_{112},T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+, T_{12}=0,T_{111}=0,T_{1111}+\frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}=0\right)\nonumber\\
=&\, p\left(T_{22},T_{112}, T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+, T_{1111}+\frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}=0\right)\,.
\end{align}

For the cusp caustic, it sufficed to construct realizations with the linear constraints $T_{11}=1/b_+$, $T_{12}=0$, $T_{111}=0$ and reject realizations for which $T_{22} > T_{11}$. For the swallowtail caustic, we implement a more advanced rejection scheme to efficiently sample the constrained manifold.

In the joint distribution of the statistic $(T_{11},T_{22},T_{112},T_{1111})$, the variable $T_{112}$ is independent of the statistics $T_{11}, T_{22}$ and $T_{1111}$. Moreover, note that the conditions $T_{1111}+\frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}=0$ and $T_{112}<0$ fully specify $T_{112}$ in terms of the variables $T_{11},T_{22}$ and $T_{1111}$. We use these properties to construct a rejection sampling scheme in which we sample the Gaussian distribution for $(T_{22},T_{1111})$ and accept a sample with a probability determined by the joint distribution for $(T_{22},T_{112},T_{1111})$.

Consider the Gaussian joint distribution $p(T_{11},T_{22},T_{1111})$ with vanishing mean $\bm{\mu}=\bm{0}$ and the covariance matrix $\begin{pmatrix} a & \bm{b} \\ \bm{b}^T & \Sigma \end{pmatrix}$ consisting of the elements
\begin{align}
a=\frac{3 \sigma_2^2}{8}\,, \quad
\bm{b}=\left(\frac{\sigma_2^2}{8}, -\frac{5 \sigma_3^2}{16}\right)\,,\quad
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3 \sigma_2^2}{8} & -\frac{\sigma_3^2}{16} \\ -\frac{\sigma_3^2}{16} & \frac{35 \sigma_4^2}{128}\end{pmatrix}, 
\end{align}
and the independent statistics $T_{112}$, which is normally distributed with zero mean $\langle T_{112}\rangle = 0$ and variance $\langle T_{112}^2\rangle = \sigma_3^2/16$. The conditional distribution $p(T_{22},T_{1111}|T_{11}=1/b_+)$ is a bivariate Gaussian distribution with non-zero mean $\bar{\bm{\mu}}=\frac{\bm{b}}{a b_+}$ and the covariance matrix $\bar{\Sigma}=\Sigma -\frac{1}{a} \bm{b}\bm{b}^T$. After sampling from this distribution, we first reject samples for which $T_{22}>1/b_+$ or $T_{1111}>0$ to obtain samples from the auxiliary probability density 
\begin{align}
p(T_{22},T_{1111}| T_{22} < T_{11}=1/b_+,T_{1111}\leq 0)\,.
\end{align}

 The variables $T_{22},T_{1111}$ fully determine the variable $T_{112}$,
\begin{align}
T_{112}= -\sqrt{-\frac{T_{1111}(T_{11}-T_{22})}{3}}\,,
\end{align}
when $T_{22} < T_{11}$ and $T_{1111}\leq 0$.  The unnormalized conditional density is the product of the conditional density $p(T_{22},T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+,T_{1111}\leq 0)$ and a function assuming values between $0$ and $1$,
\begin{align}
&p(T_{22},T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+, T_{1111}+3T_{112}^2/(T_{11}-T_{22}) =0)\nonumber\\
& \propto e^{-\frac{1}{2}((T_{22},T_{1111})-\bar{\bm{\mu}})\bar{\Sigma}^{-1}((T_{22},T_{1111})-\bar{\bm{\mu}}) }\Theta(1/b_+-T_{22})\Theta(-T_{1111})e^{ \frac{8T_{1111} (1/b_+ - T_{22})}{3 \sigma_3^2}}\,,
\end{align}
with the Heaviside step function $\Theta$. Hence, we obtain samples of the target distribution by sampling from the conditional density $p(T_{22},T_{1111}|T_{22}\leq T_{11}=1/b_+,T_{1111}\leq 0)$ and accepting samples with probability 
\begin{align}
\exp\left[ \frac{8T_{1111} (1/b_+ - T_{22})}{3 \sigma_3^2}\right]\,.
\end{align}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Umbilic cluster}
The umbilic caustic forming at time $t$ satisfies the conditions
\begin{align}
b_+(t) \lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) = b_+(t) \lambda_2(\bm{q}_c) = 1\,.
\end{align}
In terms of the second order derivatives of the displacement potential, these eigenvalue conditions can be expressed in terms of three linear conditions
\begin{align}
T_{11}&=T_{22}=1/b_+(t)\,,\\
T_{12}&=0\,.
\end{align}
At the umbilic points, the determinant 
\begin{align}
\det(\nabla \bm{x}_t) = \det (I- b_+ \bm{\psi})
\end{align}
assumes a critical point, whose nature is determined by the Hessian
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+(t) \bm{\psi})\right] =
b_+^2(t)\begin{pmatrix} 
2(T_{111}T_{122} -T_{112}^2) & T_{111}T_{222}-T_{112}T_{122} \\
T_{111}T_{222}-T_{112}T_{122} & 2(T_{112}T_{222}-T_{122}^2)
\end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{align}
and its determinant
\begin{align}
&\det\left( \mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+(t) \bm{\psi})\right]\right) \nonumber\\
&=b_+^4(t)\left[
 6 T_{111} T_{112} T_{122} T_{222} + 3 T_{112}^2 T_{122}^2  - 4 (T_{111} T_{122}^3 + T_{112}^3 T_{222})  - T_{111}^2 T_{222}^2\right]\,,
\end{align}
see \cite{Rozhanskii:1984}. Note that the Hessian at the critical point only depends on the third order derivatives of the deformation potential. The fourth order derivatives cancel when $T_{11}=T_{22}=1/b_+$ and $T_{12}=0$. The umbilic point is an elliptic caustic $D_4^+$ when the critical point is a maximum, or a minimum, \textit{i.e.}, for which 
\begin{align}
\det (\mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+ \bm{\psi})\right]) >0\,.
\end{align}
The umbilic point is an hyperbolic caustic when the critical point is a saddle point, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
\det (\mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+ \bm{\psi})\right]) <0\,.
\end{align}
This condition should be contrasted with the condition presented in \cite{Delmarcelle:1995, Lavin:1997, Hidding:2016, Feldbrugge:2018} based on the sign of 
\begin{align}
\delta = \frac{1}{2}(T_{111} T_{122} + T_{112} T_{222} - T_{112}^2  - T_{122}^2 ).
\end{align} 
In fact, this condition describes the behaviour of the eigenvector field in the vicinity of the umbilic point and does not differentiates between the elliptic and hyperbolic caustics. Note that for the elliptic caustic we always have $\delta <0$.

More generally, expand the displacement field $\bm{s}_t$ to quadratic order in $q_1$ and $q_2$ around a umbilic point at the origin $(q_1,q_2)=(0,0)$. The determinant of the gradient $\nabla \bm{x}_t$ has a critical point at the origin, as it is the product of two eigenvalue fields that vanish at the origin. The determinant takes the general form
\begin{align}
\det \nabla \bm{x}_t&=\det(I + \nabla \bm{s}_t)\nonumber\\
&= 
A q_1^2 + B q_1 q_2 + C q_2^2 + O(q_1^3,q_1^2 q_2,q_1 q_2^2,q_2^3)\,.
\end{align}
for some constants $A,B,$ and $C$.
%with
%\begin{align}
%A&= s_{1,11} s_{2,12}-s_{1,12} s_{2,11}\,,\\
%B&= s_{1,11} s_{2,22}-s_{1,22} s_{2,11}\,,\\
%C&= s_{1,12} s_{2,22}-s_{1,22} s_{2,12}\,, 
%\end{align}
%where we write the displacement field as $\bm{s}_t=(s_1,s_2)$ and the partial derivatives as $s_{i,jk}=\partial_j \partial_k s_{i}$. 
For small $q_1$ and $q_2$, the level set $\det \nabla \bm{x}_t =0$ approaches a conic section:
\begin{itemize}
\item an ellipse when the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ is negative corresponding to the $D_4^+$ caustic,
\item a hyperbole when the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ is positive corresponding to the $D_4^-$ caustic,
\item a parabola when the discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ vanishes, corresponding to the $D_5$ caustic (which does not feature in the 2D cosmic web).
\end{itemize}
Note that the discriminant coincides with the negative of the determinant of the Hessian, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
B^2-4AC = -\det \left(\mathcal{H} \left[\det \nabla \bm{x}_t \right]\right)\,.
\end{align}
When the displacement field is a gradient field, the constants $D$ and $E$ vanish and the condition reduces to the constant discussed above.


The orientation of the elliptic umbilic caustic is determined by the behaviour of the eigenvector fields of the deformation tensor in the vicinity of the caustic. The fold curve in the vicinity of the elliptic umbilic caustic is a small ellipse, which forms three cusp caustics when the eigenvector field is parallel to the eigenvector field, $\bm{v}_i \cdot \bm{m} = 0$ with $\bm{m}$ the vector normal to this circle.

The orientation and configuration of the hyperbolic umbilic caustic is determined by the eigenvalues $\nu_i$ and eigenvectors $\bm{w}_i$ of the Hessian $\mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+ \bm{\psi})\right]$. The cusp curve of the hyperbolic umbilic is directed towards the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue. The angle $\beta = 2 \arctan(\sqrt{|\nu_1/\nu_2|})$ describes the angle between the two wedges of the fold curves. 


In figure \ref{fig:meanHyperbolic}, we plot the mean field of the elliptic and the swallowtail caustic. Observe that the umbilic caustics join three cusp curves and are naturally associated to the clusters of the cosmic web.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Sampling the constraint manifold}
We implement the umbilic caustics by sampling random fields with the linear constraints
\begin{align}
T_{11}&=T_{22}=1/b_+\,,\\
T_{12}&=0\,.
\end{align}
We subsequently determine the sign of the determinant $\det\left( \mathcal{H}\left[\det (I- b_+ \bm{\psi})\right]\right)$ to identify whether it is an elliptic or an hyperbolic caustic. Given the identification, we compute its orientation. By rotating the second order and third order derivatives (using appendix \ref{ap:rotations}), we generate linear constraint conditions corresponding to elliptic and hyperbolic caustics with a specified orientation. Given the appropriate sampling of the constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$, we can evaluate the mean field, the variance of the residue and representative realiations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The residue}
By definition, the residue $\delta f$ vanishes at the point where we impose the caustic condition. However, the caustic condition not only fix the random field at a point, but influences the direct environment of the condition. This behaviour is formally described by the variance in the density perturbation near the constraint (equation \eqref{eq:variance_Linear} for linear and equation \eqref{eq:variance_Nonlinear} for non-linear constraints). We can observe this behaviour in the mean field and the variance of the density perturbation near the caustics (see figure \ref{fig:mean_var_dens}). Note that the statistical properties of the residue near the cusp and swallowtail caustic are not isotropic or homogeneous. However, the residue is isotropic near the umbilic caustics. For the power-law power spectrum with the Gaussian smoothing at the length scale $R_s=5\text{ Mpc}$ considered in this paper, the characteristic correlation length for the random field near the caustics is about $20\text{ Mpc}$.

\section{Composite constraint realizations}\label{sec:composite_constraints}
To study the interplay between the voids, walls, filaments and clusters in the cosmic web and study the connectivity, it is important to extend constraint theory of the caustic skeleton to include multiple constraints with specified orientations. In this section, we show how to construct realizations with composite constraints.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Orienting constraint conditions}\label{sec:orientation}
In section \ref{sec:caustic_skeleton_constraints}, we demonstrated a method to construct realizations of Gaussian random fields satisfying a caustic constraint at a single point with a fixed orientation. For example, we constructed realizations which included a cusp filament running vertically through the origin of the initial conditions. From the formalism, it follows that the caustic constraint can be translated to any point in the box by shifting the underlying linear functionals $\bm{C}$ (the Fourier transform of the constraints receives a phase shift). Alternatively, we can generate a realization with a cusp at the origin and translate the origin to the required location using the symmetry of the torus on which the realization lives. Unfortunately, the later method does not work when considering multiple caustic constraints at different locations. Moreover, the second method yields difficulties for even a single caustic constraint when attempting to change the orientation with a rotation due to the symmetries of the boundary conditions of the box.

Fortunately, there exists a efficient method to generate realizations with any preferred orientation at any location:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Generate a realization satisfying the caustic conditions at a given point in the box with a fixed orientation as described in section \ref{sec:caustic_skeleton_constraints}. 
\item 
Analyse the derivatives in the caustic conditions. For example, from equations \eqref{eq:cusp_cond_1} and \eqref{eq:cusp_cond_2}, we note that the cusp caustic is fully determined by a number of second, third, and fourth order derivatives.
\item
Evaluate all derivatives of the realization to the relevant order. Generally, some derivatives were obtained while sampling the constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$. Others do not directly influence the caustic, and are sampled from the realization. For the cusp, we evaluate the partial derivatives 
\begin{align}
T_{11},T_{12},T_{22},T_{111},T_{112},T_{122},T_{222},T_{1111},T_{1112},T_{1122},T_{1222},T_{2222}\,.
\end{align}
Alternatively, we can extend the constraint manifold to include all these partial derivatives and sample them directly.
\item 
While rotating the coordinate system by an angle $\theta$, the $n$-th order derivatives transform into each other (see appendix \ref{ap:rotations}). We use these transformation rules to obtain a representative sample of the required partial derivatives for the caustic with the desired orentation.
\item 
Finally, we apply the Hoffman Ribak algorithm, with respect to the linear constraints consisting of the relevant partial derivatives, to obtain a realization satisfying the caustic condition with the desired orientation.
\end{enumerate}

See figure \ref{fig:rotation} for an illustration of the cusp caustic with three orientations. In the left panel, the cusp caustic passes vertically through the centre of the box. In the central and right panels, we generate realizations for which the cusp curve passes diagonally and horizontally through the the center of the box. These three realizations share a single unconstrained random field. As a consequence, we see that the structure of the initial conditions away from the centre $(100,100)$ remains unchanged. Using constrained Gaussian random field theory, we can locally tweak the random field to satisfy the desired non-linear constraints.

\subsection{Multiple constraints}
In section \ref{sec:orientation}, we showed a method to orient a single non-linear constraint. In this section, we extend the treatment to multiple caustic constraints at different locations with specified orientations. 

Given the locations $\bm{q}_i$ and orientations $\theta_i$ of the $M$ caustics constraints with $i=1,\dots,M$, one might naively repeat the analysis presented in section \ref{sec:orientation} for each constraint point and construct the a realization using the Hoffman Ribak algorithm on the sampled partial derivatives. While this is a good approximation when the pairwise separation of the points $\bm{q}_i$ is larger that the typical correlation length of the random field, it fails when partial derivatives at a single point $\bm{q}_i$ become significantly correlated to the partial derivatives of a neighbouring point $\bm{q}_j$. Ideally, we would sample the partial derivatives of the deformation potential at the constraint points $\bm{q}_i$ simultaneously. However, such a procedure cannot be straightforwardly implemented when sampling constraints in the eigenframe and orienting the constraints with the procedure described in the previous section.

To correct for these correlations we propose a rejection sampling method. For each caustic constraint corresponding to the point $\bm{q}_i$, we determine the $n$-th order derivatives required to specify the caustic and its orientation. Construct the conditional (unnormalized) joint probability density $p_i$ for the partial derivatives of the constraint $\bm{q}_i$ with respect to the corresponding constrained manifold $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C},i}$, and the Gaussian joint probability density $p$ including all the partial derivatives at the constraint points. Next, determine the maximum $max$ of the ratio of the joint distribution of all constraint and the individual constraints $p/\prod p_i$. Finally, generate a sample of the partial derivatives satisfying the oriented caustics constraints as described above. Accept this sample with probability $p/(max\, \prod p_i)$. Alternatively, we construct the big constraint manifold $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C}$ by taking the union over the small constrained manifold $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{C},i}$, and directly sample from the conditional probability density $p(\cdot |\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{C})$ using the rejection sampling method.

\end{figure}

We illustrate this procedure in figure \ref{fig:composite}, which includes four Morse point constraints on the first eigenvalue field. A critical point $\bm{q}_c$ appearing at time $t$ satisfies the condition
\begin{align}
\nabla \lambda_1(\bm{q}_c) = 0\,,\\
\lambda_1(\bm{q}_c)=1/b_+(t)\,.
\end{align}
In the eigenvector frame, this condition reduces to the linear constraints
\begin{align}
1/b_+ = T_{11} \geq T_{22}\,, \quad  T_{12}=0\,,\quad T_{111}=T_{112}=0\,.
\end{align}
See appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel} for a derivation. The critical point is either a maximum, minimum -- corresponding to the Morse point $A_3^+$ -- or a saddle point -- corresponding to the Morse point $A_3^-$. We can differentiate between the two cases by evaluating the sign of the determinant of the Hessian $\mathcal{H}\lambda_1$. In the eigenframe the Hessian takes the form
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H}\lambda_1 = 
\begin{pmatrix} 
T_{1111}+\frac{2T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}} & T_{1112} + \frac{2 T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}} \\
T_{1112}+\frac{2 T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}} & T_{1122} + \frac{2 T_{122}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{align}
See appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel} for a derivation of this result. In figure \ref{fig:composite}, the lower, the lower, and the right critical points are $A_3^+$ points. The left and the upper critical points are $A_3^-$ points. In the right panel we can clearly distinguish the character of the $A_3^+$ and $A_3^-$ points. The $A_3^+$ points correspond to the creation of a multi-stream region forming a Zel'dovich pancake. The $A_3^-$ points correspond to the merger of two multi-stream regions.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Developing analytic methods and systematic numerical tools for the study of cosmic web is becoming increasingly important given the wealth of upcoming redshift surveys, as large $N$-body simulations are too expensive. In this paper, we extend constraint Gaussian random field theory to include non-linear constraints defined on a finite number of linear constraints, amounting to a subtle modification of the linear theory. Moreover, using the Hoffman-Ribak algorithm, we can efficiently sample the constraint distribution turning it into an universal tool for the study of the cosmic web (in both the two- and three-dimensional setting). The technique is applied to the two-dimensional caustic skeleton, linking the present-day voids, filaments and clusters to non-linear conditions on the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields of the Gaussian initial gravitational potential. Applied to cosmological $N$-body simulations, the combination of non-linear constraint Gaussian random field and caustic skeleton theory pave the way towards a systematic investigation of the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day walls, filaments, and clusters, and the embedded galaxies, putting flesh on the bones of the caustic skeleton. 

The present study illustrates non-linear constraint theory with the two-dimensional caustic skeleton. However, we do not present the full implications of the framework to caustic skeleton theory. In an upcoming paper, we will analyse the properties of the constraint field in the vicinity of the different elements of the caustic skeleton in more detail. We will evaluate how the properties of the different elements of the caustic skeleton depend on the formation times. We will moreover, study how the walls, filaments and clusters depend on the their local environments in an attempt to extract the universal properties of these elements. In particular, we will analyze how the non-linear collapse of the residue with respect to the mean field influences the density profiles near the filaments and clusters of the large scale structure. Note that, while the present analysis is restricted to the two-dimensional cosmic web, the techniques straightforwardly apply to the three-dimensional setting.

\section{Gaussian random fields algorithms}\label{ap:GRF}
Gaussian random fields are most naturally expressed in Fourier space, as the Fourier modes of an unconstrained Gaussian random field are normally and independently distributed, 
\begin{align}
p(\hat{f}(\bm{k}_1), \hat{f}(\bm{k}_2), \dots) = \prod_{i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi P(\bm{k}_i)}} \exp\left[-\frac{|\hat{f}(\bm{k}_i)|^2}{2P(\bm{k}_i)}\right],
\end{align}
up to the reality condition, $\hat{f}(\bm{k})=\hat{f}^*(-\bm{k})$. In this paper, we use Fast Fourier Transform routines to efficiently generate realizations of both unconstrained and linearly constrained Gaussian random.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Unconstrained Gaussian random fields}
We can efficiently generate realizations of an unconstrained Gaussian random fields on a rectangular lattice using Fast Fourier Transform routines. The Fourier modes of an isotropic and homogeneous Gaussian random field are independent distributed Gaussian variables with zero mean, $\mu=0$, and the standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{P(\|\bm{k}\|)}$. Using this observation we generate the realization by multiplying the Fourier transform of white noise with the square root of the power spectrum:\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1ex, leftmargin=0cm, rightmargin=1cm]
\item Generate a realization of white noise $n_w(\bm{q})$, consisting of identically independently distributed normal numbers $\mathcal{N}(\mu=0,\sigma^2=1)$ on a regular rectangular lattice.
\item Fast Fourier transform the white noise $\hat{n}_w(\bm{k}) = \text{FFT}[n_w(\bm{q})](\bm{k})$. The Fourier modes are independently normally distributed satisfying the reality condition $\hat{n}_w(\bm{k}) = \hat{n}_w^*(-\bm{k})$.
\item Rescale the Fourier modes with the power spectrum $\hat{f}(\bm{k}) = \sqrt{P(\bm{k})}\hat{n}_w(\bm{k})$.
\item Evaluate the inverse fast Fourier transform the rescaled modes to obtain the realization of the unconstrained Gaussian random field $f(\bm{q}) = \text{FFT}^{-1}[\hat{f}(\bm{k})](\bm{q})$.
\end{enumerate}
 \caption{Generating a realization of an unconstrained Gaussian random field on a rectangular lattice}
 \label{alg:GRF}
\end{algorithm}$ $\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Linearly constrained Gaussian random fields}
We efficiently generate realizations of constrained Gaussian random fields, satisfying a set of linear constraints $\Gamma=\{\bm{C}[f]=\bm{c}\}$, using the Hoffman Ribak algorithm \cite{Hoffman:1991, Weygaert:1996}. The algorithm is based on the observation that the residue of the random field with respect to the mean field, $\delta f = f - \langle f | \Gamma\rangle$, is a Gaussian random field whose properties are independent of the constraint values $\bm{c}$. Note that this is a special property of Gaussianity of the random field and the linearity of the constraints $\bm{C}$.

Given an unconstrained Gaussian random field $f$ with the required power-spectrum, we compute the value of the linear constraint $C_i$ using the convolution theorem
\begin{align}
C_i[f,\bm{q}_i]=\text{FFT}^{-1}[\hat{C}_i^*(\bm{k}) \hat{f}(\bm{k})](\bm{0})
\end{align}
evaluated at the origin, with the Fourier transform of the constraint $\hat{C}_i$. Assuming that the unconstrained mean field vanishes, $\langle f \rangle =0$, we evaluate the constrained mean field using the formula
\begin{align}
\langle f(\bm{q}) | \Gamma\rangle = \sum_{i,j} \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1} c_j\,,
\end{align}
with the covariance between the random field and the constraint
\begin{align}
\xi_i(\bm{q}) = \text{FFT}^{-1}[\hat{C}_i(\bm{k}) P(\bm{k})](\bm{q})\,,
\end{align}
and the covariance matrix of the constraints
\begin{align}
\xi_{ij}=\text{FFT}^{-1}[\hat{C}_i^*(\bm{k}) \hat{C}_i(\bm{k}) P(\bm{k})](\bm{0})\,,
\end{align}
evaluated at the origin. In these equations, we assume that $\bar{f}=\bar{C}_i=0$. Note that the vector $\bm{\xi}(\bm{q})=[\sum_i \xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1}]$ is a normal basis of the constraints. The mean field is the inner product of $\bm{x}$ with the constraint values, 
\begin{align}
\langle f(\bm{q}) | \Gamma\rangle = \bm{\xi}(\bm{q})\cdot \bm{c}\,.
\end{align}
We use these routines to implement the Hoffman-Ribak method:\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=1ex, leftmargin=0cm, rightmargin=1cm]
\item Generate a realization of an unconstrained Gaussian random field $g$ with the required power spectrum using algorithm \ref{alg:GRF}.
\item Evaluate the linear constraints $C_i$ of the unconstrained field $g$,
\begin{align}
d_i = C_i[g;\bm{q}_i]\,.
\end{align} 
\item Evaluate the mean field corresponding to the constraint values $d_i$,
\begin{align}
\bar{g}(\bm{q}) = \sum_{ij}\xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi^{-1}_{ij} d_j\,.
\end{align}
\item Evaluate the residue of the unconstrained field 
\begin{align}
\delta g=g - \bar{g}\,.
\end{align}
\item Since the residue $\delta g$ is statistically independent of the values $d_j$, we can identify $\delta g$ with the residue $\delta f$ of the constrained random field. The realization of the constrained Gaussian random field takes the form
\begin{align}
f(\bm{q}) = \sum_{ij}\xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi^{-1}_{ij} c_j + \delta g(\bm{q})\,.
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Constraint probability density}\label{ap:constraintDensity}
The conditional density 
\begin{align}
p(f|\Gamma) =\frac{p(f, \Gamma)}{p(\Gamma)}
\end{align}
with $\Gamma = \{\bm{C} = \bm{c}\}$ is a Gaussian density as both $p(f,\Gamma)$ and $p(\Gamma)$ are normally distributed. It thus suffices to evaluate the mean and covariance matrix. For completeness, we write the mean of the function and the constraints as $\bar{f}(\bm{q})=\langle f(\bm{q}) \rangle$ and $\bar{\bm{C}}=\langle \bm{C}\rangle$, and the covariance as
\begin{align}
\xi(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2)& = \text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1),f(\bm{q}_2))= \langle (f(\bm{q}_1) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_1))(f(\bm{q}_2) - \bar{f}(\bm{q}_2))\rangle\,,\\
\xi_i(\bm{q}) &= \text{cov}(f(\bm{q}),C_i) = \langle (f(\bm{q})-\bar{f}(\bm{q}))(C_i - \bar{C}_i)\rangle\,,\\
\xi_{ij} &= \text{cov}(C_i,C_j) = \langle (C_i - \bar{C}_i)(C_j-\bar{C}_j)\rangle\,.
\end{align}
For conciseness, we use the Einstein summation convention over the repeated dummy indices.

Define an auxiliary function $g(\bm{q}) = f(\bm{q}) + \bm{A}(\bm{q}) \cdot \bm{C}$ with $A_i(\bm{q}) = -\xi_j(\bm{q}) \xi_{ji}^{-1}$. The function $g$ is by construction independent of the variable $\bm{C}$, as they are jointly normally distributed and their covariance matrix vanishes, \textit{i.e.}, 
\begin{align}
\text{cov}(g(\bm{q}),\bm{C})
&=\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}),\bm{C}) +  \text{cov}(\bm{C},\bm{C}) \bm{A}(\bm{q})\nonumber \\
&=[\xi_k(\bm{q}) - \xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_{jk}]_{k=1}^N\nonumber\\
&=\bm{0}\,.
\end{align}
The expectation value of $g$ is $\langle g(\bm{q})\rangle = \bar{f}(\bm{q}) + \bm{A}(\bm{q}) \cdot \bar{\bm{C}}$, which we can use to evaluate the expectation value of the constrained field
\begin{align}
\langle f(\bm{q}) | \Gamma \rangle 
&=\langle g(\bm{q}) - \bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot \bm{C}|\Gamma\rangle\nonumber\\
&=\langle g(\bm{q})\rangle - \bm{A}(\bm{q}) \cdot \bm{c}\nonumber\\
&=\bar{f}(\bm{q}) + \bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot (\bar{\bm{C}}-\bm{c})\nonumber\\
&= \bar{f}(\bm{q}) + \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}(c_j -\bar{C}_j)\,.
\end{align}
When $\bar{f} = 0$ and $\bar{\bm{C}}=\bm{0}$ the expectation value reduces to the identity $\langle f(\bm{q}) | \Gamma \rangle =\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}c_j$. The covariance of the constraint field follows along similar lines
%\begin{align}
%\text{var}(f(\bm{q})|\Gamma) 
%&= \text{var}(g(\bm{q}) - \bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot \bm{C}|\Gamma) \\
%&= \text{var}(g(\bm{q})|\Gamma) + \text{var}(\bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot \bm{C}|\Gamma) -2 \bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot \text{cov}(g(\bm{q}), \bm{C}|\Gamma)\\
%&= \text{var}(g(\bm{q})) \\
%&=\text{var}(f(\bm{q}) + \bm{A}(\bm{q})\cdot \bm{C})\\
%&=\text{var}(f(\bm{q})) + \bm{A}^T(\bm{q}) \text{var}(\bm{C}) \bm{A}(\bm{q}) + 2\bm{A}(\bm{q}) \cdot \text{cov}(f(\bm{q}),\bm{C}) \\
%&=\text{var}(f(\bm{q})) + \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_{jk}\xi_{kl}^{-1}\xi_{l}(\bm{q}) - 2\xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_{j}(\bm{q})\\
%&=\xi(\bm{0}) - \xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q})\,.
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1), f(\bm{q}_2)|\Gamma) 
&= \text{cov}(g(\bm{q}_1) - \bm{A}(\bm{q}_1)\cdot \bm{C}, g(\bm{q}_2) - \bm{A}(\bm{q}_2)\cdot \bm{C}|\Gamma) \nonumber\\
&= \text{cov}(g(\bm{q}_1), g(\bm{q}_2)|\Gamma) + \text{cov}(\bm{A}(\bm{q}_1)\cdot \bm{C}, \bm{A}(\bm{q}_2)\cdot \bm{C}|\Gamma)\nonumber\\
&\ \ \  - \bm{A}(\bm{q}_1)\cdot \text{cov}(\bm{C}, g(\bm{q}_2)|\Gamma) -\text{cov}(g(\bm{q}_1) , \bm{C}|\Gamma)\cdot \bm{A}(\bm{q}_2)\nonumber\\
&= \text{cov}(g(\bm{q}_1), g(\bm{q}_2)) \nonumber\\
&=\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1) + \bm{A}(\bm{q}_1)\cdot \bm{C}, f(\bm{q}_2) + \bm{A}(\bm{q}_2)\cdot \bm{C})\nonumber\\
&=\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1), f(\bm{q}_2)) + \bm{A}(\bm{q}_1) \text{cov}(\bm{C},\bm{C}) \bm{A}^T(\bm{q}_2) \nonumber\\
&\ \ \ + \bm{A}(\bm{q}_1) \cdot \text{cov}(\bm{C},f(\bm{q}_2))+ \text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1), \bm{C}) \cdot \bm{A}(\bm{q}_2) \nonumber\\
&=\text{cov}(f(\bm{q}_1), f(\bm{q}_2)) + \xi_i(\bm{q}_1)\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_{jk}\xi_{kl}^{-1}\xi_{l}(\bm{q}_2) - 2\xi_i(\bm{q}_1)\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_{j}(\bm{q}_2)\nonumber\\
&=\xi(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2) - \xi_i(\bm{q}_1) \xi_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q}_2)\,.
\end{align}
We conclude that the residue $\delta f$ of $f$ with respect to the mean field $\langle f(\bm{q})|\Gamma\rangle =\bar{f}(\bm{q})+ \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}(c_j-\bar{C}_j)$ is a Gaussian random field with zero mean $\langle \delta f|\Gamma\rangle=0$ and variance $\langle \delta f(\bm{q})^2|\Gamma\rangle = \sigma_0^2 - \xi_i(\bm{q}) \xi_{ij}^{-1} \xi_j(\bm{q})$. Note that the residue $\delta f$ for a Gaussian random field with linear constraints is indeed independent of $\bm{c}$. The covariance of the constraint field yields the constrained probability density
\begin{align}
p(f|\Gamma) \propto  \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \iint \delta{f}(\bm{q}_1) \tilde{K}(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}_2) \delta f(\bm{q}_2)\mathrm{d}\bm{q}_1 \mathrm{d}\bm{q}_2 \right]
\end{align}
with the residue $\delta f = f-\bar{f}(\bm{q})+ \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}(c_j-\bar{C}_j)$ and the kernel $\tilde{K}$ defined as the inverse of the modified two-point correlation function, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}
\int \tilde{K}(\bm{q}_1,\bm{q}) \left[\xi(\bm{q},\bm{q}_2) - \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q}_2)\right]\mathrm{d}\bm{q}= \delta_D^{(2)}(\bm{q}_1-\bm{q}_2)\,.
\end{align}
The correction $- \xi_i(\bm{q})\xi_{ij}^{-1}\xi_j(\bm{q}_2)$ implements the statistical anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the residue.

\section{Non-linear eigenvalue relations: a direct approach}\label{ap:eigenvalueRel}
The eigenvalue and eigenvector fields are non-linear functions of the deformation tensor
\begin{align}
\bm{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix} T_{11} & T_{12} \\ T_{12} & T_{22}\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
with the partial derivatives of the displacement potential $T_{ijk\dots} = \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial q_j}\frac{\partial}{\partial q_k}\dots \Psi$. In two dimensions, the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields are the quadratic roots of the eigenequation $\bm{\psi}\bm{v}_i=\lambda_i \bm{v}_i$, with the explicit identities for the eigenvalue fields
\begin{align}
\lambda_1(T_{11},T_{22},T_{12}) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(T_{11}+T_{22} + \sqrt{4 T_{12}^2 +(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}\right)\,,\label{eq:lambda_1}\\
\lambda_2(T_{11},T_{22},T_{12}) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(T_{11}+T_{22} - \sqrt{4 T_{12}^2 +(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}\right)\,.\label{eq:lambda_2}
\end{align}
The study of Gaussian random fields satisfying non-linear caustic constraints is most concisely performed in the eigenframe, for which $T_{12}=0$ and $T_{11} \geq T_{22}$ leading to the eigenvalues $\lambda_1=T_{11}, \lambda_2=T_{22}$ and and eigenvectors
\begin{align}
\lambda_{1} &= T_{11}\,,\quad \bm{v}_1=(1,0)\,,\\
\lambda_{2} &= T_{22}\,,\quad \bm{v}_2=(0,1)\,.
\end{align}
In this section, we give an explicit derivation of several identities relating the partial derivatives of the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields and the partial derivatives of the displacement potential in the eigenframe, using an Euler angle. In appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel_alt}, we present a more efficient algebraic derivation, which more easily generalizes to the three-dimensional setting.

Using an eigenvalue decomposition we can write the deformation tensor as $\bm{\psi} = R^T \Lambda R,$ with the the diagonal matrix
\begin{align}
\Lambda = \begin{pmatrix}\lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 &\lambda_2 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
with the ordering $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2$, and the rotation matrix
\begin{align}
R = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & - \sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} \in SO(2),
\end{align}
with the Euler angle $\theta$. The decomposition yields three identies for the components of the deformation tensor $T_{11},T_{22},T_{12}$ 
\begin{align}
T_{11} &= \lambda_1 \cos^2 \theta + \lambda_2 \sin^2 \theta\,,\\
T_{22} &= \lambda_1 \sin^2\theta + \lambda_2 \cos^2 \theta\,,\\
T_{12} &= (\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)\cos \theta \sin \theta\,.
\end{align}
Solving for the Euler angle $\theta$, we obtain a representation for the normalized eigenvector fields
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_1 &=\pm (\cos(\theta), -\sin(\theta))\,,\\
\bm{v}_2 &=\pm (\sin(\theta),\ \ \ \cos(\theta))\,,
\end{align}
where the sine and cosine are expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the displacement potential
\begin{align}
\cos(\theta) &= \frac{\sqrt{T_{11} - T_{22} + \sqrt{4 T_{12}^2 +(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}}}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt[4]{4T_{12}^2 + (T_{11}-T_{22})^2}}\,,\\
\sin(\theta) &= \frac{\sqrt{2}T_{12}}{\sqrt[4]{4T_{12}^2+(T_{11}-T_{22})^2}\sqrt{T_{11}-T_{22} + \sqrt{4T_{12}^2 + (T_{11}-T_{22})^2}}}\,.
\end{align}
These relations enable us to evaluate several useful non-linear identities. We evaluate the derivatives of the eigenvalue field in a general frame and subsequently take the limit $T_{12} \to 0$ with the condition $T_{11}\geq T_{22}$. 

The first order derivatives of the eigenvalue fields in the eigenframe satisfy the linear equations
\begin{align}
\nabla \lambda_1&= (T_{111}, T_{112})\,,\\
\nabla \lambda_2&= (T_{122}, T_{222})\,.
\end{align}
The second order derivatives receive a non-linear correction
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_1^2} \lambda_1&= T_{1111} + \frac{2 T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_1 \partial q_2} \lambda_1&= T_{1112} + \frac{2 T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_2^2} \lambda_1&= T_{1122} + \frac{2T_{122}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_1^2} \lambda_2&= T_{1122} - \frac{2 T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_1 \partial q_2} \lambda_2&= T_{1222} - \frac{2 T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial q_2^2} \lambda_2&= T_{2222} - \frac{2T_{122}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,.
\end{align}

The first order derivative in the direction of the eigenvalue field naturally coincide with the first order derivatives described above
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1 &= \pm T_{111}\,,\quad
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1 = \pm T_{112}\,,\\
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2 &= \pm T_{122}\,,\quad
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2 = \pm T_{222}\,.
\end{align}
Note that these combinations transform as scalars under rotations. The second order derivatives receive an additional non-linear term due to the variation of the eigenvector fields. The second order derivatives of the first eigenvalue field take the form
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1) &= T_{1111} + \frac{3T_{112}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1) &= \pm \left[T_{1112} + \frac{3T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\right]\,,\\
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1) &= \pm \left[T_{1112} - \frac{T_{112}(T_{111}-2T_{122})}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\right]\,,\\
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_1) &= T_{1122} - \frac{T_{122}(T_{111}-2T_{122})}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,.
\end{align}
Note that the directional derivatives in the directions $\bm{v}_1$ and $\bm{v}_2$ do not commute. The second order derivatives of the second eigenvalue field yield the analogous identities
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2) &= T_{1122} + \frac{T_{112}(T_{222}-2T_{112})}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,,\\
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2) &= \pm\left[T_{1222} + \frac{T_{122}(T_{222}-2T_{112})}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\right]\,,\\
\bm{v}_1 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2) &= \pm\left[T_{1222} - \frac{3T_{112}T_{122}}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\right]\,,\\
\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_2 \cdot \nabla \lambda_2) &= T_{2222} - \frac{3T_{122}^2}{T_{11}-T_{22}}\,.
\end{align}

\section{Non-linear eigenvalue relations: an algebraic approach}\label{ap:eigenvalueRel_alt}
Unfortunately, the derivation of the non-linear eigenvalue relations presented in appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel} does not straigforwardly generalize to the three-dimensional case. It formally works, but is not sufficiently efficient in practice. However, using an algebraic approach we can reproduce the results presented in section \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel} more efficiently. This method does straightforwardly generalize to the higher-dimensional setting. We present this derivation here for the two-dimensional case in anticipation of an upcomming paper on the three-dimensional caustic skeleton and constraint random fields \cite{Feldbrugge:2022}.

In two dimensions, the eigenvalue fields are related to the principle invariants of the deformation tensor
\begin{align}
\text{Tr}\ \bm{\psi} &= T_{11} + T_{22} = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2\,,\label{eq:principle_1}\\
\text{det}\ \bm{\psi} &=  T_{11}  T_{22} - T_{12}^2 = \lambda_1 \lambda_2\,.\label{eq:principle_2}
\end{align}
Assuming $T_{11} > T_{22}$ and the ordering $\lambda_1> \lambda_2$ these equations have a unique solution (see equations \eqref{eq:lambda_1} and \eqref{eq:lambda_2}). In the eigenframe, $T_{12}=0$, we will assume the orientations $\bm{v}_1=(1,0)$ and $\bm{v}_2=(0,1)$. 

Now, apply the differential operators $\partial_i$ and $\partial_{i}\partial_j$ for $i,j=1,2$ to equations \eqref{eq:principle_1} and \eqref{eq:principle_2} to obtain a set of five equations. Rotate to the eigenframe by substituting $\lambda_1 = T_{11}$, $\lambda_2=T_{22}$, and $T_{12}=0$ and solve for $\partial_i\lambda_j$ and $\partial_i \partial_j \lambda_k$. The equations have a unique solution which coincides with the partial derivatives of the eigenvalue fields presented in appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel}.

To evaluate the directional derivatives of the eigenvalue fields in the direction of the eigenvectors, we use the chain rule 
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_i \cdot \nabla (\bm{v}_j \cdot \nabla \lambda_k)= (\bm{v}_i \cdot  \nabla )\bm{v}_j \cdot \nabla \lambda_k + \bm{v}_i (\mathcal{H} \lambda_k )\bm{v}_j \,,
\end{align}
with the Hessian $\mathcal{H}$. We already obtained identities for the derivatives of the eigenvalue fields in the eigenframe. What remains is the evaluation of the derivative of the eigenvector fields $(\bm{v}_i \cdot \nabla) \bm{v}_j$. First note that the normalization $\|\bm{v}_i\|=1$ implies the identity
\begin{align}
\bm{v}_i \cdot \partial_j \bm{v}_i=0\,.\label{eq:normal_v}
\end{align} 
The vector $\partial_i \bm{v}_j$ is normal to $\bm{v}_j$. In addition, application of the operator $\partial_j$ on the eigenequation $(\bm{\psi}-\lambda_i I)\bm{v}_i=\bm{0}$ yields the identity
\begin{align}
(\partial_j \bm{\psi} - \partial_j \lambda_i I)\bm{v}_i + (\bm{\psi}-\lambda_i I)\partial_j \bm{v}_i=\bm{0}\,. \label{eq:eigen_d}
\end{align}
Note that this equation does not yield a unique solution since the matrix $\bm{\psi}-\lambda_i I$ is singular. However, the combined system of equation \eqref{eq:normal_v} with \eqref{eq:eigen_d} is solvable. In the eigenframe, we obtain the gradient of the eigenvector fields
\begin{align}
\nabla \bm{v}_1 &= \begin{pmatrix}
0, & T_{112}/(T_{11}-T_{22})\\
0, & T_{122}/(T_{11}-T_{22})
\end{pmatrix},\\
\nabla \bm{v}_2 &= \begin{pmatrix}
-T_{112}/(T_{11}-T_{22}), & 0\\
-T_{122}/(T_{11}-T_{22}), & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
When combining the derivatives of the eigenvalue and eigenvector fields, we reproduce the remaining results presented in appendix \ref{ap:eigenvalueRel}.

\section{Rotations of derivatives of the deformation tensor}\label{ap:rotations}
Under a rotation, the derivatives of the deformation tensor transform nontrivailly. When applying the rotation matrix
\begin{align}
R_\theta = \begin{pmatrix} c  & s  \\- s  & c \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
with $c=\cos\theta$ and $s=\sin \theta$, the first, second, third, and fourth order derivatives transform into each other. The first order derivatives transform as a vector
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
c & -s \\
s &  c 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} T_1 \\ T_2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
The second order derivatives transform as
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{11} \\ T_{12} \\ T_{22} \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
c^2 & -2 c s    &  s^2 \\
c s &  c^2- s^2 & -c s \\
s^2 & 2c s      &  c^2 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{11} \\ T_{12} \\ T_{22} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
The third order derivatives transform as
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{111} \\ T_{112} \\ T_{122}\\ T_{222} \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
c^3   & -3 c^2 s        & 3 c s^2          & -s^3   \\
c^2 s &  c(c^2 - 2 s^2) & s( s^2- 2 c^2)   &  c s^2 \\
c s^2 &  s(2 c^2 - s^2) & c(c^2 -  2 s^2)  & -c^2 s \\
s^3   &  3 c s^2        & 3 c^2 s          & c^3 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{111} \\ T_{112} \\ T_{122}\\ T_{222} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
The fourth order derivatives transform as
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{1111} \\ T_{1112} \\ T_{1122}\\ T_{1222} \\ T_{2222} \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
c^4     & -4 c^3 s          & 6 c^2 s^2               &- 4 c s^3          &  s^4     \\
c^3 s   & c^2(c^2 - 3 s^2)  & 3cs(s^2 - c^2)     & s^2(3 c^2  - s^2) & -c s^3   \\
c^2 s^2 & 2cs( c^2 -  s^2)  & c^4  - 4 c^2 s^2  + s^4 & 2cs(  s^2 -  c^2) &  c^2 s^2 \\
c s^3   & s^2(3 c^2  - s^2) & 3cs( c^2 - s^2 )   & c^2(c^2  - 3 s^2) & -c^3 s   \\
s^4     & 4cs^3             & 6 c^2 s^2               & 4 c^3 s           &  c^4 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} T_{1111} \\ T_{1112} \\ T_{1122}\\ T_{1222} \\ T_{2222} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
